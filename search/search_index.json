The goals were to have a protocol, which is bandwidth-efficient and uses little battery power, because the devices were connected via satellite link and this was extremely expensive at that time. The protocol uses a publish/subscribe architecture wich is event-driven and enables messages to be pushed to clients. The central communication point is the MQTT broker, it is in charge of dispatching all messages between the senders and the rightful receivers. Each client that publishes a message to the broker, includes a topic into the message. The topic is the routing information for the broker. Each client that wants to receive messages subscribes to a certain topic and the broker delivers all messages with the matching topic to the client.

Issues While Printing \u00b6 Formlabs Official Website Below are a few known issues that can occur while your part is printing. Use the advice to minimize print process problems. Part Falls from Supports \u00b6 If a part detaches from its supports during a print, you may need to strengthen the support contact using the advanced support settings. Spesifikasi Samsung Galaxy C9 Try adjusting the touch point size and/or the support structure density. Part Doesn't Adhere to the Build Platform \u00b6 Monitor your prints from time to time to make sure they're adhering to the build platform correctly. If you realize the print has failed, simply cancel the print by holding the Form 1 button for 3 seconds, then clean the cured material from the printer. To resolve adherence issues, increase the base thickness or use the fine tuning setting to adjust the height of the build platform. Printer Stops Mid-print \u00b6 If your printer stops a print before finishing, try the following: Double-check that your printer power supply is securely plugged in and that you don\u2019t have any electrical interruptions. Allow the entire print file to transfer from your computer to the Form 1+ before disconnecting the USB cable. The file transfer can take several minutes. Disconnecting too early will result in an incomplete model. Check whether the cover is completely closed and recognized by the printer. Printer Unplugged During File Transfer \u00b6 Make sure the same instance of PreForm Software is still open. Plug the printer back in to resume the file transfer. If PreForm Software was closed, you can reload your saved scene and re-start the transfer.

To achieve that, there are three screws available to calibrate its orientation. There\u2019s a risk of the nozzle hitting the hotbed glass or the first layer not sticking on its surface when decalibrated. The following steps must be followed: 1. Click Autohome (Prepare/Autohome) so the printer axes move to their initial position. The first time, caution should be exercised because the nozzle can collide with the base plate. If it is anticipated that this will happen, manually press the Z axis end stopper. 2. Adjust the screw triggering the endstop so the nozzle almost touches the glass when clicking Auto-home. 3. Tighten or loosen the three black screws levelling the base plate. The distance between the nozzle and the glass should be 0,2 mm. (Tip: use a folded paper to check) 4. Position the extruder in the left side using your hand (in case any resistance is felt, disable the stepper motors using Prepare > DisableSteppers). Level the base plate once again using the same procedure. 5. Move the base plate to the front to level the rear end of the plate. 6. Repeat the process until its four corners are levelled. : Filament.png Load Filament \u00b6 1. Heat the extruder. Warm the hotend up to printing temperature. It is not necessary to click on Preheat, although it is advisable when wanting to print immediately after loading the spool. If that is not the case, click Men\u00fa>Control>Temperatura>Nozzle>220\u00baC. 2. Click on Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder, and rotate the wheel slightly clockwise (positive values) to extrude a few millimeters of material. This procedure will help prevent jams. 3. Click on Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder, and rotate the wheel anticlockwise (negative values) moving the gear a few steps back until the filament is free. 4. Once the old thread is out, load the new one. Click on Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder so the screws hold it tight . Move the wire slowly until the material exits trough the end of the hotend. 5. For a proper filament feeding, the idler screws must be tightened enough, offering a slight resistance when assisted with our fingers. 6. Once the extruder starts pulling the filament, tighten the screws until enough pressure is reached. 7. Once these steps are followed, the filament will be loaded and ready to print. FILAMENTS \u00b6 PLA \u00b6 - PLA (polylactic acid) is the quintessential material for 3d printing, thanks to its ease of use through deposition. It is recommended to begin in this type of manufacturing technology with this material. A great variety of colors exists and complex geometries can be achived without great difficulty. The finish is slightly glossy or semi-matte. Printing is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195\u00ba and 220\u00b0 C, depending on the supplier of the mate\u00adrial and printing speed. A layer fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45\u00ba C-55\u00ba C, no product is requiered to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring deformation, from a tempe\u00adrature of about 50 \u00b0, the parts can present it. It is dissolved in caustic soda. ABS \u00b6 - ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is one of the most widely used materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the weaknesses of the PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and requires some attention. ABS is not recom\u00admended for inexperienced users. The variety of colors is also very high and the finish is semi-matte or matte. The ABS is printed at temperatures between 210\u00ba C and 240\u00ba C depending on the supplier of the material and prin\u00adting speed. The ABS performs better with overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air can be harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA, due to material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive coating despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 \u00b0 C. If the geometry of the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further promotes adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at the oppopsite ends of the workpiece (known as warping). Filaflex \u00b6 - Filaflex is a flexible material that comes in different colours. Requires the use of a 0.6 mm nozzle. Speed 10mm/s Temperature 235\u00baC Hodbed 40\u00baC CURA SOFTWARE: PREPARE STL \u00b6 Download Cura here: https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software Machine settings \u00b6 STEPS: Toolbar/ Machine/ add new machine/ next/ other/ next/ custom/ next. : RepRap information.png Object Settings \u00b6 : settings.jpg Print settings \u00b6 - Basic settings are the general settings that you usually want to change. These settings have the most impact on the result Nozzle size: The size of the hole in your nozzle. The FabLab uses 0.4mm nozzle by default, and 0.6 for faster printing or filaflex. Layer height: The height of each layer. For print quality and printing time this is the most important setting. Usual settings are 0.2mm for a low quality print. 0.1mm for a medium quality print. 0.06mm for a high quality print. Shell thickness: The thickness of the side shells, it has to be multiple of nozzle size number. Bottom/top thickness: The bottom/top thickness is the outer shell thickness on the top and bottom. it has to be multiple of layer height number Fill density: Cura fills the internal parts of your model with a structure. This grid is made for strength and to support the top layers. The amount of infill you want is influenced by this setting. Print speed: Print speed sets the speed at which the print is put down. The default of 50mm per second. Print temperature: The print temperature is the temperature at which you print. if you want to print faster you might need to increase the temperature.210 for PLA and 240 for ABS. Support type: Supports are structures printed below the print to support parts that otherwise would be unprintable. There are 2 options here, support structures that need to touch the build platform, or support structures that can also touch the top of your model. You can modifie some aspects in(\u2026) Platform adhesion type: The platform adhesion type is a setting to help the printed object stick on the printer bed. Large flat objects might get lose from the printer bed because of an effect called warping. There is the option to use a raft, which is a thick grid under the object which scars the bottom of your print. Or a brim, which are lines around the bottom of your object and because of the larger area the corners are kept down. Brim usually gives the best results here as it does not scare the object. But it requires more room on the printer bed. Filament diameter: The filament diameter is the diameter of your filament. Reprap uses 2.9mm. Filament flow: The filament flow is a correction factor to make extrusion higher or lower than usual. Some systems or materials require a correction next to the usual diameter setting. This flow adjustment can be used for this.

FILAMENTS \u00b6 PLA \u00b6 - PLA (polylactic acid) is the quintessential material for 3d printing, thanks to its ease of use through deposition. It is recommended to begin in this type of manufacturing technology with this material. A great variety of colors exists and complex geometries can be achived without great difficulty. The finish is slightly glossy or semi-matte. Printing is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195\u00ba and 220\u00b0 C, depending on the supplier of the mate\u00adrial and printing speed. A layer fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45\u00ba C-55\u00ba C, no product is requiered to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring deformation, from a tempe\u00adrature of about 50 \u00b0, the parts can present it. It is dissolved in caustic soda. ABS \u00b6 - ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is one of the most widely used materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the weaknesses of the PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and requires some attention. ABS is not recom\u00admended for inexperienced users. The variety of colors is also very high and the finish is semi-matte or matte. The ABS is printed at temperatures between 210\u00ba C and 240\u00ba C depending on the supplier of the material and prin\u00adting speed. The ABS performs better with overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air can be harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA, due to material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive coating despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 \u00b0 C. If the geometry of the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further promotes adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at the oppopsite ends of the workpiece (known as warping). Filaflex \u00b6 - Filaflex is a flexible material that comes in different colours. Requires the use of a 0.6 mm nozzle.

These settings have the most impact on the result Nozzle size: The size of the hole in your nozzle. The FabLab uses 0.4mm nozzle by default, and 0.6 for faster printing or filaflex. Layer height: The height of each layer. For print quality and printing time this is the most important setting.

These printers emit many particles that can potentially enter the airways and lungs and should only be operated when enclosed by a hood with a filtered ventilation system to reduce particle emission rates by 97%. MATERIALS \u00b6 Zortrax Materials \u00b6 Layer Plastic Deposition is a technology in which printer is melting thermoplastic material (filament) in the extruder and apply it precisely on heated platform layer after layer. Zortrax M200 dedicated printing materials are: Z-ABS, Z-ULTRAT, Z-GLASS, Z-HIPS, Z-PCABS, Z-PETG, Z-ESD, Z-ASA Pro, Z-PLA Pro, Zortrax M300: Z-HIPS, Z-PETG, Z-GLASS, Z-ESD, Z-ASA Pro, Z-PLA Pro and Zortrax Inventure - Z-PLA, Z-PETG, Z-SUPPORT. Z-ULTRAT : Z-ULTRAT is a versatile materials that lets you prototype models with features of products manufactured using injection moulding technology, all in-house. The strong, stable, and time-resistant material is available in a wide range of colours. Applications: functional prototypes end-use parts casing prototypes for testing end-use casing parts for low volume production prototypes of consumer products mechanical parts simulating properties of elements made in injection moulding elements required to be durable and stable over time Z-HIPS : Use Z-HIPS to significantly reduce warping and visibly shorten the time you\u2019re spending on post-processing. The material has a unique mat structure that absorbs light and reduces the visibility of minor flaws. It\u2019s great for printing bigger part, housing or architectural prototypes. Applications: models with large, flat surfaces architecture mockups casing elements for testing end-use casing parts for low volume production prototypes of consumer products prototypes of mechanical parts Z-GLASS : Translucent structures. Its light-transmitting surface makes it applicable in automotive, industrial design, and architecture projects. Applications: concept models that are to imitate glass or translucent plastic functional prototypes of translucent objects translucent decorative elements parts required to be resistant to salts, acids, alkalis, and solvents Z-PETG : Durable material. It\u2019s highly resistant to salts, acids, and alkalis. The models will have a glossy surface that is also resistant to impact, time, and UV light. Applications: parts required being resistant to salts, acids, alkalis, and solvents machine components elements requiring resistance to greases and oils packaging prototypes prototypes of mechanical parts Z-PCABS : Z-PCABS emerged from combining two durable materials. Therefore it\u2019s durable and impact resistant, suited for producing casings. It\u2019s also resistant to temperatures, UV lights, and chemicals. The resistance made it a great material for automotive. Applications: consumer electronics casings automotive parts parts required to be resistant to temperature structural components Z-ABS : For printing concept models, mockups, gadgets, or figurines. Choose from a wide range of colours to catch the attention to your project. Applications: concept models gadgets and figurines display models models with moderate functional and testing properties External Materials \u00b6 PLA : Polylactic acid is the quintessential material for 3d printing, thanks to its ease of use through deposition. It is recommended to begin in this type of manufacturing technology with this material. A great variety of colours exist and complex geometries can be achieved without great difficulty. The finish is slightly glossy or semi-matte. Printing is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195\u00ba and 220\u00b0 C, depending on the supplier of the mate\u00adrial and printing speed. A layer fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45\u00ba C-55\u00ba C, no product is required to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring deformation, from a tempe\u00adrature of about 50 \u00b0, the parts can present it. It is dissolved in caustic soda. ABS : Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene is one of the most widely used materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the weaknesses of the PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and requires some attention. ABS is not recom\u00admended for inexperienced users. The variety of colours is also very high and the finish is semi-matte or matte. The ABS is printed at temperatures between 210\u00ba C and 240\u00ba C depending on the supplier of the material and prin\u00adting speed. The ABS performs better with overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air can be harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA, due to material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive coating despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 \u00b0 C. If the geometry of the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further promotes adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at the opposite ends of the workpiece (known as warping). Filaflex : Filaflex is a flexible material that comes in different colors. Requires the use of a 0.6 mm nozzle. Speed 10mm/s Temperature 235\u00baC Hodbed 40\u00baC WORKFLOW \u00b6 STL File Preparation \u00b6 STL is the standard file type used by most additive manufacturing systems. STL is a triangulated representation of a 3D CAD model. The triangulation (or poly count) of a surface will cause faceting of the 3D model. The parameters used for outputting a STL will affect how much faceting occurs. You cannot build the model smoother than the STL file. If the STL is coarse and faceted the physical 3D printed model will be coarse and faceted as well. However, the smoother/ less faceted your surface is, (the higher the poly count or triangulation) the larger your file. 3D printing can only accept a certain file size; therefore it\u2019s important to find a balance between your model, its desired surface, and the 3D printing process of your choice. Important: STL files are suitable for 3D printing only if the models they describe are \u201cwatertight\u201d, that is, they do not contain holes or gaps. To check to see if your mesh is watertight, follow the steps below: 1. Convert file to MESH -Select Object -Convert to Mesh by typing command 'MESH' -Select Polygon Count > The higher the polygon count, the smoother the surface finish 2. Check the MESH for any errors -Type 'CHECKMESH' to check mesh object for errors and problems, which include: \u2022 Degenerate faces - Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Zero length edges - Zero-length edges typically are the result of degenerate faces. Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Non-manifold edges - Use the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command and then fix with the ExtractNonManifoldMeshEdges command. \u2022 Naked edges - Naked edges can cause problems with rapid prototyping. Use the ShowEdges command to help find them or set the display mode to paint them a different color. Try the FillMeshHole, FillMeshHoles, or MatchMeshEdge commands to remove naked edges. If the mesh is still open, try the WELD Command. The Weld command will merge adjacent triangle points when 180 angle tolerance is set \u2022 Duplicate faces - Fix with the ExtractDuplicateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Faces with reversed normals. Fix with the UnifyMeshNormals command. \u2022 Disjoint pieces - Fix with the SplitDisjointMesh command. \u2022 Unused vertices - Unused vertices do not usually cause a problem, and there are no commands to for removing them in Rhino. Specific details on these commands can be found in the Rhino Help file. 3. Once the mesh is watertight, it is ready to be exported. -File > Save As -Select File Type as STL -Select File Name > Save -Select Binary -As for the other settings, always select the standard options -Click OK Z-SUITE Software Manual \u00b6 Zortrax Z-SUITE software is created specifically for Zortrax machines. Z-SUITE allows opening a .stl, .obj or .dxf file and set printing preferences. It is the only 3D printing software in which users are able to convert 2D files into 3D models and cut models directly in Z-SUITE software. It is dedicated for both Windows and Mac users. Zortrax developed an application for storing and downloading 3D models - the Zortrax Library. It is available in both Z-SUITE and online. Before starting, download the Z-SUITE here: http://support.zortrax.com/downloads/ Printer Selection: On Z-Suite start screen, select the model of the printer you are going to use. Adding a Model: Use + icon or use drag and drop option to upload a model. You may do so with models saved in an .stl or an .obj format. Select a model and click OPEN. Editing a Model: There are several options to manipulate or edit your model in Z-suite including Splitting, Rotating, Resizing, Moving, or Duplicating a model, all of which can be found on the left-hand side of the window. Preparing to Print: If your model is ready to be printed, click \u201cPrint.\u201d Set printing options: PROFILE/LAYER THICKNESS/SPEED/INFILL which are explained below. Print Settings: Normal Settings - Layer thickness: choose the height of one layer: 0,09mm/0,14mm/0,19mm/0,29mm/0,39mm (depending on the material). Finer layers provide better surface quality but make printing more time- and material-consuming. Quality (previously Speed): HIGH/NORMAL. High quality gives better looking prints but increases the printing time. Infill: Choose the model infill: MAXIMUM/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. All four types of infill are presented in the picture on the right. MAXIMUM infill allows printing with the highest strength level. But the larger infill, the more time and material is needed for such a print. Support: Select the angle at which the support structure is generated. 20\u00b0 is the default option. It means that for all hanging parts of the model the support structure is generated at a 20\u00b0 angle. Support Lite: Choose this option to generate the support structure without the outer perimeter. Support lite consumes less material and it is easier to remove. Print Cooling: You can choose the fan speed which cools down the model that is being printed. Cooling is not useful for big prints without any thin parts, whereas high cooling is better for small and thin prints. We recommend leaving the default option \u2013 AUTO. The printer will adjust the fan speed accordingly. Advanced Settings - Seam: It allows you to choose the starting point of every new layer (normal or random) Surface Layers: If you aim at achieving a thicker finishing of the model, use this function. It helps you to choose the amount of layers at the top and at the bottom Offset: this option helps to correct the internal and external dimensions of a model (in millimeters). It is possible to modify outer contours and holes dimension, however, only in the X and Y axis. Infill Advanced: -MESH Prints the model with 0% infill with horizontal surfaces (top and bottom) and the walls -SHELL Prints the model with 0% infill and no top and bottom surface layers. This option allows to choose the amount of the model wall. If you want the bottom layer to be printed, check the BOTTOM surface layer box while choosing SHELL infill. -There is a SPIRAL MODE available with SHELL option. If you choose this option, your model will be printed with no seam. Saving the Z-Code: Once the .zcode has been generated, your model is ready to be saved on the SD card. Information about your print: profile, layer thickness, infill as well as an estimated print time and material usage will be shown at the bottom of the screen. Save your .zcode on a hard drive or directly on the SD card by clicking \u201cSave to print\u201d button. Insert the SD card into the printer and start printing. LARGE PRINTS The problem of warping is frequent with large prints. Bigger models often shrink and that\u2019s why they do not stick to the platform while printing. Additionally, it is better to choose low density of infill (medium or light) or, if low density is problematic, choose mesh option. For large prints with no precise details the optimum layer thickness is 0,19mm or 0,29mm. PRINTING SMALL OBJECTS Very small objects require some additional options such as the appropriate FAN SPEED and LAYER THICKNESS. Set the lowest possible layer thickness and the additional FAN SPEED to 80-100%. PRINTING MOVEBLE PARTS While printing movable parts, it is important to keep proper spaces between particular parts. The minimum space requirement is 0.4mm for these kinds of prints. M200/M200 Plus User Manual \u00b6 Save your model onto the Zortrax SD Card (M200) or onto the Zortrax USB Stick (M200 Plus) Insert the SD Card/USB Stick on the appropriate machine To change the material, unload and load the material by selecting \"Material\" option from the menu. To unload the material, select the \u201cUnload the material\u201d option. To load the material, select \u201cLoad the material\u201d option. When the display shows the message \u201cInsert new material,\u201d insert the end of the material into the extruder and push the knob. Once the M200 finishes loading the material, it is ready to print. Remove the material remains using tweezers. Select the model. To choose the model for printing, select the \u201cModels\u201d option from the main menu. Select the model in either the .zcode format file (M200) or .zcodex (M200 Plus) and confirm by pushing the knob. The printing procedure will begin automatically. The display will show information about the extruder heating level. Once the heating has been completed, the M200 will start printing. The bar on the display shows the progress of the print. When it\u2019s done, heat the platform. Detach the model with the spatula tool and remove the model. Use pliers or a scalpel to remove the support structure from your model.

It is recommended to begin in this type of manufacturing technology with this material. A great variety of colours exist and complex geometries can be achieved without great difficulty. The finish is slightly glossy or semi-matte. Printing is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195\u00ba and 220\u00b0 C, depending on the supplier of the mate\u00adrial and printing speed. A layer fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45\u00ba C-55\u00ba C, no product is required to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring deformation, from a tempe\u00adrature of about 50 \u00b0, the parts can present it. It is dissolved in caustic soda. ABS : Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene is one of the most widely used materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the weaknesses of the PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and requires some attention. ABS is not recom\u00admended for inexperienced users. The variety of colours is also very high and the finish is semi-matte or matte. The ABS is printed at temperatures between 210\u00ba C and 240\u00ba C depending on the supplier of the material and prin\u00adting speed. The ABS performs better with overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air can be harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA, due to material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive coating despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 \u00b0 C. If the geometry of the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further promotes adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at the opposite ends of the workpiece (known as warping).

STL is a triangulated representation of a 3D CAD model. The triangulation (or poly count) of a surface will cause faceting of the 3D model. The parameters used for outputting a STL will affect how much faceting occurs. You cannot build the model smoother than the STL file. If the STL is coarse and faceted the physical 3D printed model will be coarse and faceted as well. However, the smoother/ less faceted your surface is, (the higher the poly count or triangulation) the larger your file. 3D printing can only accept a certain file size; therefore it\u2019s important to find a balance between your model, its desired surface, and the 3D printing process of your choice. Important: STL files are suitable for 3D printing only if the models they describe are \u201cwatertight\u201d, that is, they do not contain holes or gaps. To check to see if your mesh is watertight, follow the steps below: 1. Convert file to MESH -Select Object -Convert to Mesh by typing command 'MESH' -Select Polygon Count > The higher the polygon count, the smoother the surface finish 2. Check the MESH for any errors -Type 'CHECKMESH' to check mesh object for errors and problems, which include: \u2022 Degenerate faces - Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Zero length edges - Zero-length edges typically are the result of degenerate faces. Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Non-manifold edges - Use the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command and then fix with the ExtractNonManifoldMeshEdges command. \u2022 Naked edges - Naked edges can cause problems with rapid prototyping. Use the ShowEdges command to help find them or set the display mode to paint them a different color. Try the FillMeshHole, FillMeshHoles, or MatchMeshEdge commands to remove naked edges. If the mesh is still open, try the WELD Command. The Weld command will merge adjacent triangle points when 180 angle tolerance is set \u2022 Duplicate faces - Fix with the ExtractDuplicateMeshFaces command. \u2022 Faces with reversed normals. Fix with the UnifyMeshNormals command. \u2022 Disjoint pieces - Fix with the SplitDisjointMesh command. \u2022 Unused vertices - Unused vertices do not usually cause a problem, and there are no commands to for removing them in Rhino. Specific details on these commands can be found in the Rhino Help file. 3.

Z-SUITE allows opening a .stl, .obj or .dxf file and set printing preferences. It is the only 3D printing software in which users are able to convert 2D files into 3D models and cut models directly in Z-SUITE software. It is dedicated for both Windows and Mac users. Zortrax developed an application for storing and downloading 3D models - the Zortrax Library. It is available in both Z-SUITE and online. Before starting, download the Z-SUITE here: http://support.zortrax.com/downloads/ Printer Selection: On Z-Suite start screen, select the model of the printer you are going to use. Adding a Model: Use + icon or use drag and drop option to upload a model. You may do so with models saved in an .stl or an .obj format. Select a model and click OPEN. Editing a Model: There are several options to manipulate or edit your model in Z-suite including Splitting, Rotating, Resizing, Moving, or Duplicating a model, all of which can be found on the left-hand side of the window. Preparing to Print: If your model is ready to be printed, click \u201cPrint.\u201d Set printing options: PROFILE/LAYER THICKNESS/SPEED/INFILL which are explained below. Print Settings: Normal Settings - Layer thickness: choose the height of one layer: 0,09mm/0,14mm/0,19mm/0,29mm/0,39mm (depending on the material). Finer layers provide better surface quality but make printing more time- and material-consuming. Quality (previously Speed): HIGH/NORMAL. High quality gives better looking prints but increases the printing time. Infill: Choose the model infill: MAXIMUM/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. All four types of infill are presented in the picture on the right. MAXIMUM infill allows printing with the highest strength level. But the larger infill, the more time and material is needed for such a print. Support: Select the angle at which the support structure is generated. 20\u00b0 is the default option. It means that for all hanging parts of the model the support structure is generated at a 20\u00b0 angle. Support Lite: Choose this option to generate the support structure without the outer perimeter. Support lite consumes less material and it is easier to remove. Print Cooling: You can choose the fan speed which cools down the model that is being printed. Cooling is not useful for big prints without any thin parts, whereas high cooling is better for small and thin prints. We recommend leaving the default option \u2013 AUTO. The printer will adjust the fan speed accordingly. Advanced Settings - Seam: It allows you to choose the starting point of every new layer (normal or random) Surface Layers: If you aim at achieving a thicker finishing of the model, use this function. It helps you to choose the amount of layers at the top and at the bottom Offset: this option helps to correct the internal and external dimensions of a model (in millimeters). It is possible to modify outer contours and holes dimension, however, only in the X and Y axis. Infill Advanced: -MESH Prints the model with 0% infill with horizontal surfaces (top and bottom) and the walls -SHELL Prints the model with 0% infill and no top and bottom surface layers. This option allows to choose the amount of the model wall. If you want the bottom layer to be printed, check the BOTTOM surface layer box while choosing SHELL infill. -There is a SPIRAL MODE available with SHELL option. If you choose this option, your model will be printed with no seam. Saving the Z-Code: Once the .zcode has been generated, your model is ready to be saved on the SD card. Information about your print: profile, layer thickness, infill as well as an estimated print time and material usage will be shown at the bottom of the screen. Save your .zcode on a hard drive or directly on the SD card by clicking \u201cSave to print\u201d button. Insert the SD card into the printer and start printing. LARGE PRINTS The problem of warping is frequent with large prints. Bigger models often shrink and that\u2019s why they do not stick to the platform while printing. Additionally, it is better to choose low density of infill (medium or light) or, if low density is problematic, choose mesh option. For large prints with no precise details the optimum layer thickness is 0,19mm or 0,29mm. PRINTING SMALL OBJECTS Very small objects require some additional options such as the appropriate FAN SPEED and LAYER THICKNESS. Set the lowest possible layer thickness and the additional FAN SPEED to 80-100%. PRINTING MOVEBLE PARTS While printing movable parts, it is important to keep proper spaces between particular parts. The minimum space requirement is 0.4mm for these kinds of prints.","title":"Z-SUITE Software Manual"},{"location":"know-how/machines/3D%20printing/_wiki/Zortrax_M200_3D_printer/#m200m200-plus-user-manual","text":"Save your model onto the Zortrax SD Card (M200) or onto the Zortrax USB Stick (M200 Plus) Insert the SD Card/USB Stick on the appropriate machine To change the material, unload and load the material by selecting \"Material\" option from the menu.

The piece of software performing this task is called a postprocessor. Be sure to select the correct postprocessor (\"Shopbot MTC\") as well as the expected file extension (.sbp) in RhinoCAM when exporting your milling program. MCS \u00b6 ShopBot 3 Selecting the Right Bit for the Job \u00b6 Milling Tools: A milling bit (also called milling cutter or end mill) is a tool used in CNC or hand-operated milling machines to remove material in a controlled manner to obtain a desired shape. This is usually done by moving the rotating tool sideways (laterally) through the material, thus cutting chips off the workpiece. Most milling bits can also cut in the direction of the tool axis, like a drilling bit. Vice-versa however, a drilling bit is designed to cut only axially to create cylindrical holes, and cannot be used for milling. Bit material: Router bits are made from a variety of materials. The most common are solid carbide, carbide-tipped steel, and high-speed steel. Both solid carbide and carbide- tipped are good choices. We do not recommend using high-speed steel bits as they dull quickly and must be re-sharpened. Flute type: There are four basic flute types: Straight, spiral up-cut, spiral down-cut, and compression. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, which are outlined in the chart below. Parameters: Feeds and Speeds \u00b6 A challenge of getting a good CNC cut is in selecting the best bit, best cutting speed (feed rate) and router/spindle RPM (speed of rotation). Bits, feeds, and speeds are a critical part of machining and should be fully understood before deviating from recommended settings. Bits choice is important in chip load, which is a representation of the size of the chips produced during cutting. The goal is to get the maximum chip load possible to increase productivity, reduce heat, and prevent premature dulling. When chip load is too small, bits will get too hot and dull quicker. When chip load is too high, the tool will deflect creating a bad surface finish and, in extreme cases, chip or break the bit. Optimising feed rates and speeds: 1. Start off using an RPM derived for the chip load for the material being cut (see charts). 2. Increase the cutting speed (feed rate) until the quality of the part\u2019s finish starts to decrease or the part is starting to move from hold downs. Then decrease speed by 10%. 3. Decrease RPM until finish deteriorates, then bring RPM back up until finish is acceptable. 4. This optimises RPM and speed to remove the largest possible chips.

MCS \u00b6 KinetiC-NC Selecting the Right Bit for the Job \u00b6 Milling Tools: A milling bit (also called milling cutter or end mill) is a tool used in CNC or hand-operated milling machines to remove material in a controlled manner to obtain the desired shape. This is usually done by moving the rotating tool sideways (lateral direction) through the material, thus cutting chips off the workpiece. Most milling bits can also cut in the direction of the tool axis, like a drilling bit. Vice-versa, however, a drilling bit is designed to cut only axially to create cylindrical holes, and cannot be used for milling. Bit material: Router bits are made from a variety of materials. The most common are solid carbide, carbide-tipped steel, and high-speed steel. Both solid carbide and carbide- tipped are good choices. We do not recommend using high-speed steel bits as they dull quickly and must be re-sharpened. Flute type: There are four basic flute types: Straight, spiral up-cut, spiral down-cut, and compression. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, which are outlined in the chart below. Parameters: Feeds and Speeds \u00b6 A challenge of getting a good CNC cut is in selecting the best bit, best cutting speed (feed rate) and router/spindle RPM (speed of rotation). Bits,feeds, and speeds are a critical part of machining and should be fully understood before deviating from recommended settings. Bits choice is important in chip load, which is a representation of the size of the chips produced during cutting. The goal is to get the maximum chip load possible to increase productivity, reduce heat, and prevent premature dulling. When chip load is too small, bits will get too hot and dull quicker. When chip load is too high, the tool will deflect creating a bad surface finish and, in extreme cases, chip or break the bit. Optimising feed rates and speeds: =1. Start off using an RPM derived for the chip load for the material being cut (see charts). 2.

The machine will pause, then continue the work by clicking on the Play button -Emergency stop (E-stop) buttons are located in 2 places: On your remote, next to the Control PC, and On the end of the Y-Axis gantry. The Emergency Stop buttons are large, round Red buttons which will completely shut-down the machine. -Remove the tool-holder & tool from the spindle and store it in the tool-holder rack. -Clean the machine and your work area completely after you have removed your material. -Skeletons and scraps created during the process should be cut up & placed in the recycling cart. Interface \u00b6 The image below shows the interface of KinetiC-NC software. The tabs available in the software are: A. Program \u00b6 This tab lets you perform the following: 1. Load the G-Code generated from your RhinoCam. 2. View and manage the feed rate of the machine while it is running. 3. View the current coordinates of the machine. 4. Start and Stop the GCode. 5. View the tool path on the display window. By default the colour of the toolpath before running in green. As the file starts and passes the toolpath the colour changes to light blue which keeps you the track of the progress of the file. B. Jog Setup \u00b6 Here you can set the zero of the stock before you start your milling work.Its really important that you fix your tool well before you set the zero. You can use the two wrenches of 22mm to fix the milling bit to the tool head. Set X,Y,Z zero \u00b6 Setting the X,Y and Z is done by eye in the Trex 1215 CNC Machine. To set the zero please follow these instructions: 1. To set the X and Y we move the machine towards the zero set in the stock in RhinoCam. 2. While setting this, we make sure we place the tool in a way that half the tool is inside the material and half outside the material. This makes sure that the center of the tool is at the zero of the stock. 3. To set the Z we move the bit down slowly in steps until the barely touches the stock and also we move the tool and make sure it doesn't drag through the stock leaving a mark. We can use the paper technique by placing a piece of paper below the bit to set the z.

This is usually done by moving the rotating tool sideways (lateral direction) through the material, thus cutting chips off the workpiece. Most milling bits can also cut in the direction of the tool axis, like a drilling bit. Vice-versa, however, a drilling bit is designed to cut only axially to create cylindrical holes, and cannot be used for milling. Bit material: Router bits are made from a variety of materials. The most common are solid carbide, carbide-tipped steel, and high-speed steel. Both solid carbide and carbide- tipped are good choices. We do not recommend using high-speed steel bits as they dull quickly and must be re-sharpened. Flute type: There are four basic flute types: Straight, spiral up-cut, spiral down-cut, and compression. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, which are outlined in the chart below.","title":"Selecting the Right Bit for the Job"},{"location":"know-how/machines/CNC/_wiki/Trex_1215_S/#parameters-feeds-and-speeds","text":"A challenge of getting a good CNC cut is in selecting the best bit, best cutting speed (feed rate) and router/spindle RPM (speed of rotation). Bits,feeds, and speeds are a critical part of machining and should be fully understood before deviating from recommended settings. Bits choice is important in chip load, which is a representation of the size of the chips produced during cutting. The goal is to get the maximum chip load possible to increase productivity, reduce heat, and prevent premature dulling. When chip load is too small, bits will get too hot and dull quicker. When chip load is too high, the tool will deflect creating a bad surface finish and, in extreme cases, chip or break the bit. Optimising feed rates and speeds: =1. Start off using an RPM derived for the chip load for the material being cut (see charts). 2. Increase the cutting speed (feed rate) until the quality of the part\u2019s finish starts to decrease or the part is starting to move from hold downs. Then decrease speed by 10%. 3. Decrease RPM until finish deteriorates, then bring RPM back up until finish is acceptable. 4. This optimises RPM and speed to remove the largest possible chips.

Advantages \u00b6 A drill press has a number of advantages over a hand-held drill: Less effort is required to apply the drill to the workpiece. The movement of the chuck and spindle is by a lever working on a rack and pinion, which gives the operator considerable mechanical advantage The table allows a vise or clamp to be used to position and restrain the work, making the operation much more secure The angle of the spindle is fixed relative to the table, allowing holes to be drilled accurately and consistently Drill presses are almost always equipped with more powerful motors compared to hand-held drills. This enables larger drill bits to be used and also speeds up drilling with smaller bits.

It can also be used to smooth or round edges. A belt sander is rather large and if not used properly can result in damaging your wood or causing serious injury. Belt sander may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary, where the material is moved to the sanding belt. This machine can have a very aggressive action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material. It also used for removing paints or finishes from wood. Fitted with fine grit sand paper, a belt sander can be used to achieve a completely smooth surface.

Impact drivers are high-torque tools primarily used for driving screws and tightening nuts. Their chuck accepts only bits with a hex shank. You either pull up on the chuck sleeve to insert a bit or you just slip the bit into the chuck. These tools are lighter and smaller than drill drivers, and although they are not as versatile, they will perform many of the same functions. Since their torque output is higher than a typical drill driver, they get through work more quickly.

A hand router is one of the most versatile tools in woodworking. More than just a way to bevel an edge, a router can create all kinds of edge profiles, be used to square wood edges, and even used as a thickness planer to level uneven wood. Although the bearing on some router bits helps guide the blade based on a reference, sometimes you may want to make a cut with the router where there is no existing reference. Create a fence to help you Safety \u00b6 Use always safety glasses Hold and support the machine firmly on the surface, do not loose control The electric cable must extend on the opposite side of the cutting direction How to use \u00b6 Install the router bit in the collet. Removing the base will allow you easier access to the collet to change the router bit, and allow you to change the fixed base for a tilting one. Adjusting the gauge for the depth of cut you need. Set your bit depth by unbuckling the hasp and setting the depth of the fixed base. Edge-routing. Clamp the board down and move the wood router in a counterclockwise direction around the board. Conventional Vs Climbing Cut A milling cutter can cut in two directions, sometimes known as conventional (or up) and climb (or down). For almost all cutting with a palm router a conventional cut is recommended, but know that it can cause tear out when reaching the end of a cut. Bits \u00b6 Straight Bits Straight bits are most commonly used extensions for a router as they allow you to perform straight cuts. These cuts form grooves or dados. They can also be used for creating a shaft for embedding decorative parts in your newly created wooden part. Rabbeting Bits These router extensions are guided by a pilot bearing and are designed to cut shoulders. They are mostly used to create connecting wooden pieces and parts that don\u2019t require screws or nails to connect to one another. Flush Trim Bits Flush trim bits are great for evening the edges of certain materials. For example, if you have two parts that are supposed to act as a support for other parts, it\u2019s advisable that you laminate the edges and make them even. This way you\u2019ll minimize the friction and ensure that the part lasts longer. Edge Forming Bits Edge forming parts are designed to perform small but precise cuts and shafts.

Turn on the main fume extractor in the big laser cutter switch panel. Turn on the small air compressor on the left hand side of the machine. Turn on the laser cutter (left side of the machine). Make sure the material Harga Ban Motor Corsa you want to use is in the 'Materials and configuration' list. If it is not there, ask the Fab Lab responsible. Measure the size of your material board. From your vector editing software, once you are ready for printing and if you already installed the driver, press Ctrl+P or select 'Print'. Select 'Epilog Engraver' from the printer list and go to 'Printer settings' or 'Properties'. The laser cutter driver interface should appear. Here you can set-up the laser's power and speed according to how the vector paths in your drawing are organized (you can also print raster images). Harga HP Samsung For a vector job: In the 'General' tab, under 'Job type' select 'Vector'. Set the size of the material sheet under 'Piece Size'. Set to 'Vector sorting' and 'Optimize'. In the 'Color mapping' tab select the check box 'Color mapping'. You should have organized your drawing in different colors if you need to do different types of jobs (for example engraving and cutting). Once this is activated, you can set the power, the speed, and other parameters for every single color in your drawing. Take a look at the 'Materials and configuration' list above for the proper power/speed values according to the material you are using. The list order determines the execution sequence of every type of job. You should allays engrave first and cut later. You can change the order by selecting a color and pressing the up and down arrows. Once you are done with this configuration, press 'OK'. For a raster job: You should see the parts that you want to cut/engrave fitting the material in the preview. If not, you should scale, move, rotate or change the units of the drawing to get it as you want. Finalize the process with 'Print' and the file will be sent to the laser cutter. At the machine: Open the hood and place the material on the metal bed without hitting the cutting head. If the material you use is to thick (engraving bigger objects), you should lower the bed. To lower the bed: Press 'X/Y off' and bring the bed to the desired z position by pressing the 'up' and 'down' arrows. Turn on the laser pointer 'Puntero'.

Ask the FabLab operators if you're not sure about your material. Do not stand on the side of the machine! Only in the front. The machine can move suddenly and quickly and can hit you. Do not continue cutting if something is going wrong! For example: if there is flame or a lot of smoke or it's not cutting or the material is melting. Pause the machine and call a FabLab operator. Do not change the material on the remote! It has to be \"cardboard\" always. Materials and configuration \u00b6 Wood: \u00b6 Plywood is a manufactured wood panel made from thin sheets of wood veneer. It is one of the most widely used wood products. It is flexible, inexpensive, workable, re-usable, and can usually be locally manufactured. Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product formed by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is denser than plywood. 0.5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 52 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 15 3mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 30 Power: 190 ENGRAVE Speed: 70 Power: 60 Plywood: \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 40 Power: 180 Bent Plywood: \u00b6 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 90 Power: 130 ENGRAVE Speed: 110 Power: 40 MDF \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 30 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 35 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 50 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 50 6mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 220 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 7mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 260 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 10mm \u00b6 CUT Speed:13 Power: 330-340 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 RASTER Speed: 600 Power: 80 12mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 370 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 60 12mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 380 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 60 13mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 10 Power: 370 15mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 5 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 70 IN HIGH DENSITY WOOD SUCH AS MDF THE MAXIMUM THICKNESS IS 15 mm Poplar Plywood / Contraplacat Pollancre \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 35 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 90 Power: 30 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 10mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: 90 Power: 30 15mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 5 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 25mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 22 Power: 255 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 60 RASTER Speed: 500 Power: 150 Cardboard: \u00b6 Cardboard is a generic term for a heavy-duty paper of various strengths, ranging from a simple arrangement of a single thick sheet of paper to complex configurations featuring multiple corrugated and uncorrugated layers. 1mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 80 1.5mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 70 Power: 100 2mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 110 Power: 115 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 80 3mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 50 Power: 90 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 35 1mm Black \u00b6 CUT Speed: 90 Power: 90 4mm Rippled \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 65 6mm Rippled \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 160 Acuarela \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 96 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 48 Cartulins Com\u00fan / Generic Cardboard \u00b6 CUT Speed: 120 Power: 90 ENGRAVE Speed: 200 Power: 46 Metacrilato/Methacrylate: \u00b6 Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a transparent thermoplastic, often used as a light or shatter-resistant alternative to glass.

Open EnRoute. If it's already open \u2013 go straight to step 2 2. Open a new file ( File - New ) and set your sheet size (width/heigh in mm, thickness is not important) 3. Import your .dxf file: File \u2013 Import \u2013 find your file 4. Make sure that your drawing is inside the red border. If you need to scale or move your drawing: select everything and press F2 on the keyboard 5. Select everything and go to Transform \u2013 Merge selection\u2026 and click OK 6. If you are using two strategies (engraving and cutting) harga tablet terbaru then go to Layers ( Setup - Layers ) and turn the engraving layer ON and the cutting layer OFF 7. Select all and click on the 'Engraving...' button (Toolpath - Engraving), in the drop-down menu select your Strategy \u2013 'eng' and click OK. You will see the generated paths for your design 8. Go to Layers again and switch your cutting layer ON and the engraving one OFF 9. Select all and go to Engraving again but this time choose 'cut' in the drop-down menu 10. Switch all the layers ON. You will see all your paths together 11. Click the 'Output option' ( Machining - Output ) icon. Go to the 'Tool Order' section and make sure that 'engrave' is the first. If not \u2013 drag it up (click on the left box next to the number when the cursor will be an arrow to drag it up). If you have smaller pieces inside bigger pieces (holes, openings, etc.) then in 'Object Order' check 'Inside out'. Also check 'Small parts first'. Press 'To File' 12. Save your file inside 'Dnc files' folder. Use one of the existing folders (MAA, FabAcademy, etc.). You can also create your own folder 13. Done! Your file is sent to the machine File:image.png|1 (laser1).png|2 (laser3).png|3 (laser4).png|5 (laser5).png|6 laser(6).png|7 laser(7).png|8 laser(8).png|9 laser(9).png|10 laser(10).png|11 Notes \u00b6 Bring your files in .dxf 2004 format so that you can import them directly to EnRoute. You are not allowed to edit your files on this computer. Do not open EnRoute multiple times, you can just open a new file in the same window. If you have engraving and cutting you should have them in different layers. Do not change material thickness. All the dimensions are in millimeters. Your file units have to be millimeters. If you have a grid put all the horizontal elements in one layer and all the vertical ones \u2013 in another. If you are using AutoCAD or Grasshopper: use Rhino command 'Make2D' in all your layers separately. Your file has to be flat (on 0 in Z axis). Your home is in the lower left edge of your sheet and has to be in 0, 0, 0.

It is one of the most widely used wood products. It is flexible, inexpensive, workable, re-usable, and can usually be locally manufactured. Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product formed by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is denser than plywood. 0.5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 52 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 15 3mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 30 Power: 190 ENGRAVE Speed: 70 Power: 60 Plywood: \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 40 Power: 180 Bent Plywood: \u00b6 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 90 Power: 130 ENGRAVE Speed: 110 Power: 40 MDF \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 30 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 35 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 50 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 50 6mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 220 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 7mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 260 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 10mm \u00b6 CUT Speed:13 Power: 330-340 ENGRAVE Speed: 60 Power: 60 RASTER Speed: 600 Power: 80 12mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 370 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 60 12mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 15 Power: 380 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 60 13mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 10 Power: 370 15mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 5 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: 50 Power: 70 IN HIGH DENSITY WOOD SUCH AS MDF THE MAXIMUM THICKNESS IS 15 mm Poplar Plywood / Contraplacat Pollancre \u00b6 4mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 35 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 90 Power: 30 5mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 185 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 10mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 20 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: 90 Power: 30 15mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 5 Power: 375 ENGRAVE Speed: Power: 25mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 22 Power: 255 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 60 RASTER Speed: 500 Power: 150 Cardboard: \u00b6 Cardboard is a generic term for a heavy-duty paper of various strengths, ranging from a simple arrangement of a single thick sheet of paper to complex configurations featuring multiple corrugated and uncorrugated layers. 1mm \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 80 1.5mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 70 Power: 100 2mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 110 Power: 115 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 80 3mm Grey \u00b6 CUT Speed: 50 Power: 90 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 35 1mm Black \u00b6 CUT Speed: 90 Power: 90 4mm Rippled \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 150 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 65 6mm Rippled \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 160 Acuarela \u00b6 CUT Speed: 100 Power: 96 ENGRAVE Speed: 100 Power: 48 Cartulins Com\u00fan / Generic Cardboard \u00b6 CUT Speed: 120 Power: 90 ENGRAVE Speed: 200 Power: 46 Metacrilato/Methacrylate: \u00b6 Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a transparent thermoplastic, often used as a light or shatter-resistant alternative to glass.

By doing so, you will be setting the work area in your graphics software to match the LaserPro Spirit GE\u2019s worktable area. NOTE Please make sure Spirit GE is set to the default printer before proceeding to the page and layout setup. Ensure that the LaserPro Spirit GE has been selected as the DEFAULT PRINTER. You can do so by going into your Windows Control Panel : Printers and Faxes. If LaserPro Spirit GE is not selected as DEFAULT PRINTER, you may set it up through the graphics software as well. The following is taking Corel Draw as example of how to set up LaserPro Spirit GE as the Printer. 1) From the primary menu, click FILE : PRINT SETUP. 2) From the navigation bar Name, click Spirit GE : OK Page Setup and Orientation \u00b6 The first thing you must do before working with the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver will be to make sure the page and layout settings are properly configured within your graphics software. You will need to access and edit the Page Setup or Layout page of your graphics software to set your graphics software\u2019s page layout to match the LaserPro Spirit GE\u2019s work table\u2019s dimensions and orientation. From your graphic software\u2019s Page Setup page: - Set the page orientation in the graphics software to Landscape mode. Set page size horizontal length to 812 mm (31.968 inches) and vertical height to 460 mm (18.110 inches). Corel Draw Example (Page Setup and Orientation) Spirit GE User Manual \u00b6 The following is an example of how to set the Page Setup and Orientation in the graphics software. CorelDraw is the designated graphics software used for this example. For other graphics software, you will need to access the corresponding Page Setup page. 3) From the primary menu 4) From the navigation bar on the left 5) Ensure that NORMAL PAPER and LANDSCAPE are selected. 6) Ensure the Paper Width and Height dimensions match the LaserPro Spirit GE\u2019s work table dimensions of 812 mm (31.968 inches) and 460 mm (18.110 inches). 7) Click OK to complete the paper size adjustment. TIP Instead of manually selecting the Landscape and setting the Paper Width and Height, you can simply click the Set From Printer function and CorelDraw will automatically set the proper orientation and dimensions based on LaserPro Spirit GE\u2019s work table. (You MUST have the Spirit GE set as the default printer prior to doing this.) Color Management \u00b6 LaserPro driver uses pen color settings to control laser engraver engraving and cutting parameters. In addition to having your Page Setup and Orientation properly set in your graphics software, you will also need to make sure Color Management is DISABLED prior to working with the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver. If you do not properly From your graphic software\u2019s Color Management page: . Disable Color Management or set Color Management to Off. Corel Draw Example (Color Management) The following is an example of how to properly disable Color Management in the graphics software. CorelDraw is the designated graphics software used for this example. For other graphics software, you will need to access the corresponding Color Management page. 1) From the primary menu, click TOOLS : COLOR MANAGEMENT and CorelDraw\u2019s Color Management will appear. 2) Under the Style pull down menu, select COLOR MANAGEMENT OFF. 3) Click OK to complete the color management adjustments. 5.2.3 Using the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver Now after you have properly set the Page and Layout and Color Management of your graphics software, you are ready to configure the details of your actual job through the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver. The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver allows you to adjust your engraving / cutting options. After you have setup your image, design, or text to be engraved in your software application, you can access the LaserPro Spirit GE print driver by going to FILE : PRINT : PROPERTIES. Note For this screenshot example, CorelDraw was used as the software application. The LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver consists of seven primary sections (pages) in which you will be able to choose various engraving / cutting options and settings: . Option Page . Pen Page . Advance Page . Paper Page . Language Page . Raster Page (appears only in Black & White Mode) . Stamp Page (appears only in Stamp Mode) TIP The following sections describe the specific functions for each of the settings found in the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver. If you are new to laser engraving, it is recommended that you first familiar yourself with the general principals of the laser process in Section 6, especially the Vector Cutting and Raster Engraving concepts. This will make it easier to understand the various descriptions and terminology used in this section. LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver >> Option Page \u00b6 Mode Setting (OPTION PAGE) [DEFAULT SETTING: Black & White] You can select four primary mode settings, depending on your application or results you would like to achieve. Black & White: Select this mode when using clipart images or drawings with several colors, shades of gray, or many outlines. This mode outputs in a method similar to that of a black and white laser printer. The entire selected image will be engraved using a single set of power & speed settings (the black pen from the PEN menu. Please refer to the next section of the manual for details regarding the PEN functions). The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver will interpret colored and shaded areas as different shades of gray by producing a halftone effect while engraving. Instead of engraving only solid lines, gray/halftone areas will be a collection of dots with varying density. The resolution and depth of these halftone areas can be adjusted with the DPI setting found on the Options page. Please note that selecting the Black & White mode will add a new Raster page to the menu. The Black & White mode dithering settings can be changed from the Raster page. (Please refer to the Raster section below for details). Experiment with different dithering settings to attain the desired results. TIP The Black & White mode interprets the processed image by the varying colors and shades. For the best results, we suggest you convert the image to a grayscale image with your graphics software prior to engraving in the Black & White mode. NOTE Selecting the Black & White mode will enable the Raster page on the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver, allowing you to adjust advanced stamp-related settings. Manual Color Fill: Select this mode when you would like to designate specific power and speed settings and link them to certain colors of your image. The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver allows a maximum of 16 pen parameters to be set. 3D Mode: Select this mode to attain a sculptured 3D effect on your engraving. By using images that have a range of gray areas, the LaserPro Spirit GE print driver can manipulate the image to give it added depth, by linking the laser power (depth of engraving) to specific colors. The settings can be adjusted through the DPI setting (Option page) and PPI, power and speed settings (Pen page). Stamp Mode: Select this mode to when you would like to engrave stamps. The stamp mode is one of the more dynamic functions of the LaserPro Spirit GE. Due to the unique engraving nature when engraving a stamp, the stamp production requires different operational steps than most engraving or cutting operations. NOTE Selecting the Stamp mode will enable the Stamp page on the Spirit GE Print Driver, allowing you to adjust advanced stamp-related settings. DPI (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 500] DPI (dots-per-inch) represents the number of times the laser will fire over a one-inch path. This setting determines the image resolution and quality when performing raster engraving functions. Higher DPI settings result in cleaner and deeper engravings, but require a more time to complete. Lower DPI settings result in coarser and shallower engravings, but require less time to complete. The LaserPro Spirit GE offers 8 DPI options: 125, 250, 300, 380, 500, 600, 760, and 1000, experiment with different settings to get your desired effect. Below is a chart for your convenience detailing the Set DPI (your input setting) vs. Actual DPI (your output results). Set DPI 125 250 300 * 380 500 600 * 760 1000 Actual DPI 127 254 381 381 508 762 762 1016 NOTE* Outputting a full-table (34\u201d x 18\u201d) job using 300 or 600 DPI will result in a truncation error; this is due to the large differences in set DPI vs. actual DPI output for those two particular DPI settings. Therefore, when processing a 34\u201d x 18\u201d job using 300 DPI, we recommend you move to the next higher DPI setting of 380. Similarly, for a 34\u201d x 18\u201d job using 600 DPI, we recommend you use 760 DPI. Mirror (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this box will automatically engrave your image with a mirrored effect. This setting will flip the image along the Y-axis from left to right and vice-versa. TIP When engraving a stamp, via the stamp mode, the stamp image needs to be engraved in reverse (mirrored) for the final stamp to be correctly laid out. Invert (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this box automatically inverts / reverses the color of your image (the white areas become black and vice versa). The Invert option is not available in disabled with Manual Color File mode selected. TIP Invert mode is useful when creating a stamp in Stamp Mode, as inverting your normal image will set the negative space to be engraved out, with the remaining positive space (your stamp design) protruding out. Mirror Effect Invert Effect Print Immediately (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this will instruct the LaserPro Spirit GE to immediately begin the laser engraving process, when you select Print from your graphic software program. If Print Immediately is not checked, then selecting Print will transfer the job file to the LaserPro Spirit GE system and will need to be initialized from the LaserPro Spirit GE control panel. SmartACT (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] SmartACT is reduces the amount of time it takes to process a job, by eliminating unnecessary travel of the laser carriage at the expense of some quality. Usually the quality loss is minimal, but will depend on the image or design you are working with; please take some time to experiment with your particular design to determine whether the tradeoff is acceptable. TIP There is a greater performance gain when enabling SmartACT for designs that are vertically longer than they are horizontally wide, as the SmartACT optimization modifies the movement of the X-axis of the laser carriage. File Function (Option Page): The file function section allows you to manage various laser parameters. This section is useful when performing repeat jobs on a variety of objects, allowing you to save your frequently used laser parameters and load them in the future. \udbc0\udc83 History File: This section contains a list of the recent files you have recently created and worked with, please note that. \udbc0\udc83 SAVE: This function will save the current print driver parameter settings to a file and location on your computer of your selection. (Saved parameter setting files will be tagged with the .H2O extension) \udbc0\udc83 LOAD: This function allows you load a previously saved print driver parameters. \udbc0\udc83 ORIGINAL: This function will load the print driver\u2019s original factory parameter settings. \udbc0\udc83 SAVE TO DEFAULT: This function allows you to save your current print driver parameters as the default startup settings. \udbc0\udc83 DELETE: This function will delete the file you select from the History File section. Please note the delete function only removes the file from the history file section, it does not remove the .H2O file from your hard drive, if you wish to completely remove the file from your hard disk, and you will have to manually delete the file from your operating system.) NOTE If you are using Windows 2000 or XP as your operating system, then make sure you log in with an administrator or administrator-rights account in order to properly save laser parameter settings. Spirit GE Print Driver >> Pen Page \u00b6 The LaserPro Spirit GE incorporates the use of 16 different colors to represent 16 different laser power and speed settings when cutting and engraving. These colors are referred to as \u201cPens\u201d. Think of each pen as a designated laser setting, rather than as a color. As an example, a black and white image will use only one power and speed laser setting (Black). An image that is made up of black, red and blue colors will be processed using the laser settings designated for each particular color. In order to utilize up to 16 different pens (laser parameter settings), make sure your graphics software can recognize and utilizes the 16 pen colors designated by the Spirit GE print driver. If you would like to specify your own colors to designate to a particular laser setting, then all you have to do is to double-click on that particular pen color from the pen menu and a color manager window will open where you can select \u201cdefine custom colors\u201d to define your own color (shown in the picture below). This is useful when your image is composed of colors that are not part of the pen menu\u2019s default color selection, and instead of modifying your image, you simply would like to assign the laser settings based on the existing colors based on your current image. NOTE The Spirit GE print driver cannot store more than 16 pen colors or different laser parameter settings per file. Speed (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 50] The speed slider controls the laser\u2019s speed during operation (engraving speed) with a range setting from 0.1 \u2013 100%. The Spirit GE\u2019s maximum laser processing speed is 60 inches per second, therefore a setting of 100% speed is equivalent to 60 inches per second and a 10% speed setting would be equivalent to 6 inches per second. Keep in mind, this is the speed the laser moves at when cutting or engraving straight lines. The machine will automatically slow down when processing curves. TIP Cutting / engraving depth and quality are determined by a combination of power and speed. Slower speeds at higher power will produce deeper cuts and engravings, whereas higher speeds at lower power will produce more shallow cuts and engravings. Power (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 50] The power slider controls the laser\u2019s power during operation (engraving power) with a range setting from 1 \u2013 100%. The percentage setting represents the power for each laser pulse fired. TIP Cutting / engraving depth and quality are determined by a combination of power and speed. Higher power and slower speeds will produce deeper cuts and engravings, whereas lower power and higher speeds will produce more shallow cuts and engravings. PPI (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 400] PPI (pulses-per-inch) represents the number of times the laser pulses (fires) per linear inch, exclusive for vector cutting. Higher PPI settings will generate deeper, overlapping laser pulses, resulting in cleaner cuts. Lower PPI settings (lower than 150) will result in the individual laser pulses being spread apart, resulting in a perforated effect (similar to the perforation in the paper between mailing stamps). If you drag the PPI slider to the furthest right (maximum), the value will change to X. This completely disables the PPI control and continuously fires the laser non-stop, without pulsing. Think of setting PPI to X as being equivalent to turning a water facet on with the water continuously flowing out. This also disables the power ramp functionality, which automatically controls the PPI depending on the speed of the laser carriage (such as vector cutting around the corner of a square). TIP For Vector Engraving jobs, we recommend a PPI setting > 150 For Vector Cutting jobs, we recommend a PPI setting of > 400 Raster / Vector (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Selected] Checking the Raster checkbox will process only the raster functions for the areas of your design that correspond to that particular \u201cpen\u201d color. Checking the Vector checkbox will process the vector functions for the areas of your design that correspond to that particular \u201cpen\u201d color. As an example: a particular \u201cpen\u201d color may be assigned to areas in your design containing color fills (raster engraving) and very thin lines (vector cutting). By checking / unchecking the Raster and Vector will force the driver to process / ignore the color fills / thin lines. - 63 - Spirit GE User Manual Vector Checked Vector Unchecked Raster Checked Processes both Vector and Raster functions for that particular color Processes only the Raster functions for that particular color (Vector functions ignored) Raster Unchecked Processes only the Vector functions for that particular color (Raster functions ignored) Does not process Vector or Raster functions for that particular color Air (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This checkbox controls the SmartAIR air-assist function (if you have the optional air compressor installed). By selecting a pen color and checking this box will enable the SmartAIR air-assist function for that particular pen color. As an example, if you are performing a combination of both surface raster engraving job and deep vector cutting on a material such as acrylic, you may want to enable the SmartAIR air-assist for the vector cutting sections to get the cleanest cuts. To do this, you would simply need to select the pen color that you have assigned to the sections to be cut and select the Air checkbox for those particular pen color. Auto Focus (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This checkbox sets the Auto Focus for that particular job. With the Auto Focus button checked, the Spirit GE will automatically initialize the auto focus procedure before starting the job. This will ensure the focal distance is properly set based on the particular material you are working with and the focal lens you have installed. Spirit GE Print Driver >> Advance Page \u00b6 Scaling (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 0] In some cases you may find a slight output inaccuracy in the actual output compared to what you have set in the computer. This margin of error or offset is extremely small (approximately 1/300). What this means that there may be a 1-unit offset for every 300 unit increments. As an example, if you engrave a 300mm straight line, it may end up measuring only 299mm or 301mm in the final output. In this case, you will want to set the scaling setting to +1 / 1000 or -1 / 1000, respectively to compensate. A general rule of thumb is for every 300 unit increment, you will want to adjust the slider by +1 if the final output is 1 unit increment shorter or -1 if the final output is 1 unit increment longer than your graphic design setting. Position Modes (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Home] These selections allow you to control the positioning of the laser head after each job completion and before the next subsequent job. \udbc0\udc83 Home: Resets the positioning of the laser head to the \u2018home position\u2019 (upper-right) before and after each job. - 65 - Spirit GE User Manual \udbc0\udc83 Without Home: The laser head will start the next job based on its position from its graphic application software setting, from the last position of the previous job. Upon completion of the current job, the laser head will remain at the last position of the previous job. \udbc0\udc83 Relative: This mode sets the current laser head position to correspond to the origin (top left) position of the graphic software. Therefore, the laser head will process the job from its current position relative to its setting in the graphics software. \udbc0\udc83 Center: Sets the current position of the laser head as the center point for your subsequent job. As an example, if the subsequent job is to vector cut a circle and you have the Position Mode set to Center, then the Spirit GE will vector cut a circle around the initial position of the laser head. TIP It is highly recommended you enable the red dot laser pointer when setting / adjusting the Position Modes, as this makes accurate positioning of your laser carriage for your particular jobs much easier. Image Output Direction (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Top To Bottom] These selections allow you to control the direction in which the system processes an engraved image. \udbc0\udc83 Top To Bottom: Selecting this will force the system to process the current task by moving the laser carriage from the top to the bottom of the image (rear end to front end of the work table). \udbc0\udc83 Bottom To Top: Selecting this will force the system to process the current task by moving the laser carriage from the bottom to the top of the image (front end to rear end of the work table) (Normally, the LaserPro Spirit GE engraves from left to right, top to bottom. Selecting Bottom Up will force the machine to start from the bottom and work its way to the rear of the working table. TIP In situations where the material you will be working with may produce a lot of dust byproducts and you are utilizing the optional air extraction system, it is recommended you select the Bottom To Top image output direction option. This will minimize the amount of dust byproducts lodged in the engraved sections as the air extraction system is vented from the rear of the machine, the same direction as the image is processed. Border (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] In cases where you are working with a negative image (negative outline areas of your image are engraved, rather than the positive areas), you may wish to include a border around your image. To properly add a border, you will first need to Invert your design from the Option Page, then check Use Border and specify a value for the thickness of the border you would like to add to your design. This mode is useful for engraving rubber stamps, as it allows you to create the outline around your stamp image. NOTE If you wish to use the Border and Cluster function simultaneously, then the Border Thickness value must be less than the Distance value specified in the Cluster setting. Vector Function (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Normal] \udbc0\udc83 Normal: This selection will not apply any special advanced vector function to your job. This is the default Vector Function setting. \udbc0\udc83 All Raster Output: This selection will instruct the print driver to process your entire image as a raster engraving. Any vector lines within the image will be treated as raster data and outputted as a raster engraving, similar to a dot-matrix printer. \udbc0\udc83 Vector Sorting: When performing a vector cutting job in which your image has one vector cut area enclosing within another vector cut area, select the vector sorting mode. This mode will automatically instruct the print driver to process the inside vector image and moving outwards. If you try to process a vector image that has multiple layers without using this mode, what may occur is the laser engraver may process the outer vector cutting first, and any inner vector cutting will not be possible as your centerpiece material may have dropped to the cutting table. This setting will always automatically direct the laser to cut from the inner most vector shape and move outwards. \udbc0\udc83 Optimization Sorting: This is a setting that will minimize your process time. When selected, the print driver will analyze your image and automatically determine the most efficient processing path to process your image. Use Cluster (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This setting allows you to change how the Spirit GE interprets and processes individual / independent areas of an image in order to minimize job-processing times. The Cluster function is only applicable when multiple areas of an image are broken down and isolated from each other (areas not touching each other, blank space in-between). Another condition that must be met for the Cluster function is that these individual areas of your design must have some X-axis overlap, meaning that they should be somewhat side-by-side with empty space between them. The distance value can be set by the user and represents the limit or cutoff point in which side-by-side objects will be processed in Cluster mode or not. If the distance between side-by-side objects is greater than the set distance value, then the individual areas will be processed in Cluster mode. Conversely, if the distance between side-by-side objects is lesser than the set distance value, then the individual areas will be processed normally (not via Cluster mode). An example of an image that would benefit from the Cluster function would be: 2 squares to be engraved, side-by-side on the X-axis with a 20 cm gap in between them. In this scenario, you would want to enable the Cluster setting and set the distance to a value less than 20. By doing so, the laser will completely process one square and \u201cleap-frog\u201d to the second square, rather than processing both squares simultaneously. The result: you shorten the processing time by minimizing the unnecessary travel distance the laser head needs to make across the X-axis in between squares, if they were to be processed simultaneously. NOTE If you wish to use the Border and Cluster function simultaneously, then the Border Thickness value must be less than the Distance value specified in the Cluster setting. Enhanced Vector Mode (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This setting allows you to improve the cutting quality at the expense of speed. Your engraving speed will be dropped 50%, to maximize the cutting power. We recommend you enable this function when cutting thicker materials. Spirit GE Print Driver >> Paper Page \u00b6 Paper Size (Paper Page) The paper size represents your total work area. Ensure that the paper size is never set greater than the Spirit GE\u2019s worktable area of 25\u201d x 18\u201d (640mm x 460mm) or 29\u201d x 20\u201d (740mm x 460mm) with the Extend option checked. The X value represents the length and the Y value represents the width. NOTE When using the optional rotary attachment system and with the Rotary Fixture option checked, the X value represents the length of your working piece. The Y value will be changed to Diameter, which represents the diameter of your working piece (at the position you wish to engrave). Unit (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Metric (mm)] Here you can set your preferred measurement standard in which you would like use with the Spirit GE print driver. You can choose between metric or imperial standards. Image Tuning (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 0] In the event that you are processing extremely fine and detailed designs requiring near-microscopic edge-to-edge precision, you will need to adjust the image tuning setting. To adjust this setting, we recommend you engrave a small black square design as a sample and apply a magnifying glass to the engraved results. When you look at your engraved test square under a magnifying glass, you may notice the edges of your square may be slightly offset, with every consecutive engraved even or odd line protruding past the square\u2019s ideal edge. This occurrence may occur on the left or right side of the square and can be compensated for by the image tuning setting. In the diagram below, the arrows refer to the direction the laser head is moving to generate that engraved line. If the first and every other line protrude to the left of the square\u2019s ideal edge, you will want to set the image tuning to a negative value. If the first and every other consecutive line protrude to the right of the square\u2019s ideal edge, you will want to set the image tuning to a positive value. The further the protruding lines are from the square\u2019s ideal edge, the larger you will need to set the Image Tuning value to compensate. The following is an example of how having the proper image tuning is important when engraving fine, small, intricate text. The following two pictures show engraved text magnified with no image tuning (left picture) and image tuning enabled (right picture). Extend (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] If you are processing a very large area requiring the maximum worktable area, you will want to enable this mode. Enabling this mode will extend the Spirit GE\u2019s maximum work area to 38\u201d x 18\u201d (960mm x 460mm), from the default 32\u201d x 18\u201d (812 mm x 460mm). This function is enabled at the expense of Square\u2019s Left Edge Square\u2019s Right Edge - 70 - Spirit GE User Manual some quality, usually on the left and right edges of your full-size engraving. Usually the quality loss is minimal and may not be apparent, depending on your design. NOTE With the Extend function enabled, the following functions are disabled: 3D Mode (Option Page), Stamp Mode (Option Page), SmartACT (Option Page), Disable Skip White (Advance), Auto Focus (Pen Page), and Rotary Fixture (Paper Page). Dual Head (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] NOTE This option is only to be used with the Dual-Head optional accessory properly set up. For instructions on how to set up the Dual Head, please refer to Chapter VII of this manual. This function allows you to process two identical jobs at the same time through the employment of a secondary laser carriage. With the dual-head optional accessory properly set up: 1) Check the Dual-Head function to enable it. The X (width) value of the paper size will shrink from 64cm to 37cm, to accommodate for simultaneous jobs. The Y (height) value remains the same. 2) Simply lay out your work on a maximum page size of 31cm x 46cm. Prepare your work as if you were making only a single piece, the laser system and dual-head will automatically take care of the duplication process. Rotary Fixture (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] NOTE This option is only to be used with the Rotary Attachment optional accessory properly set up. For instructions on how to set up the Rotary Attachment, please refer to Chapter VII of this manual. You will need to select the option when processing a job with the optional rotary attachment system to engrave on rounded or cylindrical objects. When you have your material and rotary attachment properly set up: 1) Check the Rotary Fixture function and notice the change in the Paper Size fields. Under Paper Size, the X value represents the length of your work piece. Enter the length of your work piece in this field. 2) Under Paper Size, the Diameter value represents the diameter of your working piece (at the position you wish to engrave). Enter the diameter of your work piece in this field. Again, remember the proper diameter value would be the diameter location, at the point of engraving on your work piece. 3) Under Rotary Parameter, the Offset value represents distance from the open end of your work piece to the base of the padded rubber wheel. This value will be displayed on the Spirit\u2019s LCD panel. Enter the proper offset value in this field. Uninstall Driver (Paper Page) Select this to uninstall the Spirit GE print driver. You will then need to restart your computer to complete the process. Spirit GE Print Driver >> Language Page \u00b6 This page allows you specify the language displayed by the Spirit GE Print Driver. Current language options allow for: English, Spanish, French, And Chinese (Simplified, Traditional), Japanese, and German. - 72 - Spirit GE User Manual 5.2.3.6 Spirit GE Print Driver >> Raster Page NOTE The Raster Page is only available when Black & White Mode Setting is selected from the Option Page, this page offers a number of advanced Raster Engraving output options. Contrast (Raster Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 0] A quick and easy way to immediately adjust the contrast of an engraved image. Moving the slider to the Dark setting will increase the contrast levels of the engraved output, whereas moving the slider to the Light setting will decrease the contrast levels of the engraved output. TIP There are other ways to adjust an engraved image\u2019s contrast such as: adjust the power / speed settings or simply adjusting the contrast of the image in software with the graphic software application. - 73 - Spirit GE User Manual Halftone (Raster Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Dithering] This option controls the way a raster-engraved image is processed. The \u201cdigital image to engraved output\u201d process can be processed via two methods: Dithering or Error Diffusion. Each offer additional output options yielding different output effects, style, and quality. \udbc0\udc83 Dithering: Interprets and outputs the raster engraving via the dithering method. This mode will allow you to select the Pattern Type and Dithering Matrix, and Enhanced Dithering. o Pattern Type: Dot, Bayer, Corner, 45 Degree [DEFAULT SETTING: Dot] Each pattern type uses a different shape and arrangement of dots to compose the shading effect of a raster image. The following diagram is an example of the raster effects when using the different pattern types. Dot Bayer Corner o Dithering Matrix: Variable depending on the Pattern Type selected. [DEFAULT SETTING: 8x8] This controls the resolution (dot size) and the number of dots the image is broken down into for the dithering process. As an example, selecting 2 x 2 will shade with a 5-grade halftone, where as an 8 x 8 Dithering Matrix will dither with a 65-grade halftone. The following diagram is an example of the raster effects when using the different dithering matrices. 2 x 2 Dithering 8 x 8 Dithering 2 x 2 (Enhance Dithering) 8 x 8 (Enhance Dithering) - 74 - Spirit GE User Manual o Enhance Dithering [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Selecting this will produce a finer dithering output. \udbc0\udc83 Error Diffusion (Raster Page): Interprets and outputs the raster engraving via the error diffusion method. This mode will allow you to select from three diffusion types: Floyd, Stucki, and Jarvis. o Diffusion Type: Floyd, Stucki, Jarvis [DEFAULT SETTING: Floyd] Each diffusion type presents the shade of image as different spread halftones instead of dots to compose a raster image. The following diagram is an example of the raster effects when using the different diffusion types. Floyd Stucki Jarvis TIP There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d setting when using the Raster options. The most appropriate settings will be based on a variety of factors: your design, the material you are engraving on, the results you wish to achieve, etc. Please take some time to experiment with the multitude of raster options to get the one you feel is the best for your piece. This is where much of the fun in engraving is\u2026.experimentation! - 75 - Spirit GE User Manual 5.2.3.7 Spirit GE Print Driver >> Stamp Page Producing stamps require different operational steps than your standard engraving or cutting jobs. The Stamp page offers dynamic options allowing you to customize your stamp production process. NOTE The Stamp page will only appear and be accessible when you have selected the Stamp Mode from the Option Page. TIP Functions located on the other pages that are useful when making a stamp: Set Shoulder, Pitch, Border, Invert, and Mirror. Pitch (Stamp Page) Your stamp will be a reversed image composed of engraved depressions and ridges. Think of these ridges as the \u201ccontact sections\u201d of the stamp. If the ridges of these contact sections are too thin, they may break. The Pitch setting allows you to increase the width of the ridge base, hence creating more stable \u201ccontact sections\u201d and longer lasting stamp. The pitch value setting allows you to adjust the base width of Base of ridge (Pitch) Slope of ridge (Shoulder Level) Ridge: \u201cContact section\u201d of the stamp the ridge. Broad pitch gives the maximum amount of support for each ridge. Experiment with different pitch value settings in order to produce the stamp that is best suited for your application. Adjustment Bar / Power Level (Stamp Page) Another important aspect of creating a stamp is setting the slope level of the shoulder. The shoulder is the section from the \u201ccontact section\u201d of the stamp to its base. This function allows you to adjust the slope for the shoulder sections of your stamp. By sliding the sliders or directly input of power levels, you will be able to change the slope of the shoulder. NOTE The visual representations of the Pitch and Shoulder Levels in the Spirit GE driver are an exaggerated representation to allow for easy visual guidance and precise input. Remember we are working with distances less than 1 mm here. Engraving and Cutting Techniques \u00b6 Raster Engraving \u00b6 A laser engraver can process text, scanned image, digital picture, or design by \u201claser firing\u201d grids / dots of individual pixels into a raster image. Think of this as simply \u201cprinting\u201d your job onto any particular material. An example of a raster engraved piece would be a photo engraving on tile, as shown in the picture below. Vector Cutting \u00b6 A laser engraver can process text, design, and images composed of lines through continuous-firing of the laser to cut out various shapes. When performing vector cutting operations, imagine the laser head as a pair of scissors cutting out the lines specified in your design. An example of a vector cut piece would be a customized dining mat, as shown in the picture below. The Spirit GE Print Driver determines which sections should be raster engraved or vector cut based on the outline width of that particular area or section of the design. In order to prep a particular section for vector cutting, you will need to set that object\u2019s fill color to white and set its outline thickness between 0.001\u201d (0.025mm) to 0.004\u201d (0.1mm) via the graphics software. Below is an example of how to prep an area (in this case, we will use a section of text) for vector cutting. CorelDraw will be used as the selected graphics software. 1) With the text function, create a string of characters and select those characters by clicking on the text. 2) Change the text fill color of the selected characters to white by left clicking on the white color from the CorelDraw Color Palette (located on the right hand side of the screen). 3) Change the outline color of the selected characters outline by right clicking on the desired color from the CorelDraw Color Palette. 4) Change the selected characters outline thickness to the thinnest width by right clicking on the selected text \udbc0\udcc6 select \udbc0\udcc6 Click on the tab and change the Width to its thinnest dimension. Click on \u201cOK\u201d to apply the changes. 5) Now your string of characters has been properly designated as an area to be vector cut. Simply \u201cprint\u201d your job (output the file to the Spirit) and watch as your string of characters is vector cut. Vector and Raster \u00b6 In some cases, you will want to process both raster engraving and vector cutting tasks within a single project. For example, if you wanted to engrave a design onto a particular material and then cut a particular shape around that engraving. The picture below is an example of an engraving on a piece of cork, which has then been cut out with a square shape: In these situations when there are raster engraving and vector cutting operations on a single project, the LaserPro Spirit GE driver will interpret between raster sections and vector sections by the types of lines and line widths of your design. Areas of your design with line widths set between 0.001\u201d (0.025mm), 0.004\u201d (0.1mm) will be designate for vector cutting, and the other areas will be designated for raster engraving. 3D Tips \u00b6 When doing 3D sample on LaserPro Spirit GE, acrylic or MDF wood are ideal materials for the purpose. For acrylic the suggested PWR is 100%, SPD around 30% (depends on how deep you want to cut). (REVISE THIS SECTION WITH MORE SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS, INSTEAD OF GENERALITIES) The perfect image for 3D is like those shown below. When image is ready, choose 3D Effect as the output mode in the driver. Sometimes, some material (WHAT SORT OF MATERIALS?) shows better effect if you run the job with 2 nd pass with laser out-of-focus. Especially with acrylic, the 2 nd pass will smooth out the surface. For engraving wood, as it burns easily and leaves blackened surface after the 1 st pass, it is necessary to run the 2 nd pass to remove the burned surface. To do that, simply fill the image with black color as the mask (see below) and Run the black mask image with PWR 100% and SPD100%.

The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver allows you to adjust your engraving / cutting options. After you have setup your image, design, or text to be engraved in your software application, you can access the LaserPro Spirit GE print driver by going to FILE : PRINT : PROPERTIES. Note For this screenshot example, CorelDraw was used as the software application. The LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver consists of seven primary sections (pages) in which you will be able to choose various engraving / cutting options and settings: . Option Page . Pen Page . Advance Page . Paper Page . Language Page . Raster Page (appears only in Black & White Mode) . Stamp Page (appears only in Stamp Mode) TIP The following sections describe the specific functions for each of the settings found in the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver. If you are new to laser engraving, it is recommended that you first familiar yourself with the general principals of the laser process in Section 6, especially the Vector Cutting and Raster Engraving concepts. This will make it easier to understand the various descriptions and terminology used in this section.","title":"Color Management"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#laserpro-spirit-ge-print-driver-option-page","text":"Mode Setting (OPTION PAGE) [DEFAULT SETTING: Black & White] You can select four primary mode settings, depending on your application or results you would like to achieve. Black & White: Select this mode when using clipart images or drawings with several colors, shades of gray, or many outlines. This mode outputs in a method similar to that of a black and white laser printer. The entire selected image will be engraved using a single set of power & speed settings (the black pen from the PEN menu. Please refer to the next section of the manual for details regarding the PEN functions). The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver will interpret colored and shaded areas as different shades of gray by producing a halftone effect while engraving. Instead of engraving only solid lines, gray/halftone areas will be a collection of dots with varying density. The resolution and depth of these halftone areas can be adjusted with the DPI setting found on the Options page. Please note that selecting the Black & White mode will add a new Raster page to the menu. The Black & White mode dithering settings can be changed from the Raster page. (Please refer to the Raster section below for details). Experiment with different dithering settings to attain the desired results. TIP The Black & White mode interprets the processed image by the varying colors and shades. For the best results, we suggest you convert the image to a grayscale image with your graphics software prior to engraving in the Black & White mode. NOTE Selecting the Black & White mode will enable the Raster page on the LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver, allowing you to adjust advanced stamp-related settings. Manual Color Fill: Select this mode when you would like to designate specific power and speed settings and link them to certain colors of your image. The LaserPro Spirit GE print driver allows a maximum of 16 pen parameters to be set. 3D Mode: Select this mode to attain a sculptured 3D effect on your engraving. By using images that have a range of gray areas, the LaserPro Spirit GE print driver can manipulate the image to give it added depth, by linking the laser power (depth of engraving) to specific colors. The settings can be adjusted through the DPI setting (Option page) and PPI, power and speed settings (Pen page). Stamp Mode: Select this mode to when you would like to engrave stamps. The stamp mode is one of the more dynamic functions of the LaserPro Spirit GE. Due to the unique engraving nature when engraving a stamp, the stamp production requires different operational steps than most engraving or cutting operations. NOTE Selecting the Stamp mode will enable the Stamp page on the Spirit GE Print Driver, allowing you to adjust advanced stamp-related settings. DPI (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 500] DPI (dots-per-inch) represents the number of times the laser will fire over a one-inch path. This setting determines the image resolution and quality when performing raster engraving functions. Higher DPI settings result in cleaner and deeper engravings, but require a more time to complete. Lower DPI settings result in coarser and shallower engravings, but require less time to complete. The LaserPro Spirit GE offers 8 DPI options: 125, 250, 300, 380, 500, 600, 760, and 1000, experiment with different settings to get your desired effect. Below is a chart for your convenience detailing the Set DPI (your input setting) vs. Actual DPI (your output results). Set DPI 125 250 300 * 380 500 600 * 760 1000 Actual DPI 127 254 381 381 508 762 762 1016 NOTE* Outputting a full-table (34\u201d x 18\u201d) job using 300 or 600 DPI will result in a truncation error; this is due to the large differences in set DPI vs. actual DPI output for those two particular DPI settings. Therefore, when processing a 34\u201d x 18\u201d job using 300 DPI, we recommend you move to the next higher DPI setting of 380. Similarly, for a 34\u201d x 18\u201d job using 600 DPI, we recommend you use 760 DPI. Mirror (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this box will automatically engrave your image with a mirrored effect. This setting will flip the image along the Y-axis from left to right and vice-versa. TIP When engraving a stamp, via the stamp mode, the stamp image needs to be engraved in reverse (mirrored) for the final stamp to be correctly laid out. Invert (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this box automatically inverts / reverses the color of your image (the white areas become black and vice versa). The Invert option is not available in disabled with Manual Color File mode selected. TIP Invert mode is useful when creating a stamp in Stamp Mode, as inverting your normal image will set the negative space to be engraved out, with the remaining positive space (your stamp design) protruding out. Mirror Effect Invert Effect Print Immediately (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] Checking this will instruct the LaserPro Spirit GE to immediately begin the laser engraving process, when you select Print from your graphic software program. If Print Immediately is not checked, then selecting Print will transfer the job file to the LaserPro Spirit GE system and will need to be initialized from the LaserPro Spirit GE control panel. SmartACT (Option Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] SmartACT is reduces the amount of time it takes to process a job, by eliminating unnecessary travel of the laser carriage at the expense of some quality. Usually the quality loss is minimal, but will depend on the image or design you are working with; please take some time to experiment with your particular design to determine whether the tradeoff is acceptable. TIP There is a greater performance gain when enabling SmartACT for designs that are vertically longer than they are horizontally wide, as the SmartACT optimization modifies the movement of the X-axis of the laser carriage. File Function (Option Page): The file function section allows you to manage various laser parameters. This section is useful when performing repeat jobs on a variety of objects, allowing you to save your frequently used laser parameters and load them in the future. \udbc0\udc83 History File: This section contains a list of the recent files you have recently created and worked with, please note that. \udbc0\udc83 SAVE: This function will save the current print driver parameter settings to a file and location on your computer of your selection. (Saved parameter setting files will be tagged with the .H2O extension) \udbc0\udc83 LOAD: This function allows you load a previously saved print driver parameters. \udbc0\udc83 ORIGINAL: This function will load the print driver\u2019s original factory parameter settings. \udbc0\udc83 SAVE TO DEFAULT: This function allows you to save your current print driver parameters as the default startup settings. \udbc0\udc83 DELETE: This function will delete the file you select from the History File section. Please note the delete function only removes the file from the history file section, it does not remove the .H2O file from your hard drive, if you wish to completely remove the file from your hard disk, and you will have to manually delete the file from your operating system.) NOTE If you are using Windows 2000 or XP as your operating system, then make sure you log in with an administrator or administrator-rights account in order to properly save laser parameter settings.","title":"LaserPro Spirit GE Print Driver >> Option Page"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#spirit-ge-print-driver-pen-page","text":"The LaserPro Spirit GE incorporates the use of 16 different colors to represent 16 different laser power and speed settings when cutting and engraving. These colors are referred to as \u201cPens\u201d. Think of each pen as a designated laser setting, rather than as a color. As an example, a black and white image will use only one power and speed laser setting (Black). An image that is made up of black, red and blue colors will be processed using the laser settings designated for each particular color. In order to utilize up to 16 different pens (laser parameter settings), make sure your graphics software can recognize and utilizes the 16 pen colors designated by the Spirit GE print driver. If you would like to specify your own colors to designate to a particular laser setting, then all you have to do is to double-click on that particular pen color from the pen menu and a color manager window will open where you can select \u201cdefine custom colors\u201d to define your own color (shown in the picture below). This is useful when your image is composed of colors that are not part of the pen menu\u2019s default color selection, and instead of modifying your image, you simply would like to assign the laser settings based on the existing colors based on your current image. NOTE The Spirit GE print driver cannot store more than 16 pen colors or different laser parameter settings per file. Speed (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 50] The speed slider controls the laser\u2019s speed during operation (engraving speed) with a range setting from 0.1 \u2013 100%. The Spirit GE\u2019s maximum laser processing speed is 60 inches per second, therefore a setting of 100% speed is equivalent to 60 inches per second and a 10% speed setting would be equivalent to 6 inches per second. Keep in mind, this is the speed the laser moves at when cutting or engraving straight lines. The machine will automatically slow down when processing curves. TIP Cutting / engraving depth and quality are determined by a combination of power and speed. Slower speeds at higher power will produce deeper cuts and engravings, whereas higher speeds at lower power will produce more shallow cuts and engravings. Power (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 50] The power slider controls the laser\u2019s power during operation (engraving power) with a range setting from 1 \u2013 100%. The percentage setting represents the power for each laser pulse fired. TIP Cutting / engraving depth and quality are determined by a combination of power and speed. Higher power and slower speeds will produce deeper cuts and engravings, whereas lower power and higher speeds will produce more shallow cuts and engravings. PPI (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 400] PPI (pulses-per-inch) represents the number of times the laser pulses (fires) per linear inch, exclusive for vector cutting. Higher PPI settings will generate deeper, overlapping laser pulses, resulting in cleaner cuts. Lower PPI settings (lower than 150) will result in the individual laser pulses being spread apart, resulting in a perforated effect (similar to the perforation in the paper between mailing stamps). If you drag the PPI slider to the furthest right (maximum), the value will change to X. This completely disables the PPI control and continuously fires the laser non-stop, without pulsing. Think of setting PPI to X as being equivalent to turning a water facet on with the water continuously flowing out. This also disables the power ramp functionality, which automatically controls the PPI depending on the speed of the laser carriage (such as vector cutting around the corner of a square). TIP For Vector Engraving jobs, we recommend a PPI setting > 150 For Vector Cutting jobs, we recommend a PPI setting of > 400 Raster / Vector (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Selected] Checking the Raster checkbox will process only the raster functions for the areas of your design that correspond to that particular \u201cpen\u201d color. Checking the Vector checkbox will process the vector functions for the areas of your design that correspond to that particular \u201cpen\u201d color. As an example: a particular \u201cpen\u201d color may be assigned to areas in your design containing color fills (raster engraving) and very thin lines (vector cutting). By checking / unchecking the Raster and Vector will force the driver to process / ignore the color fills / thin lines. - 63 - Spirit GE User Manual Vector Checked Vector Unchecked Raster Checked Processes both Vector and Raster functions for that particular color Processes only the Raster functions for that particular color (Vector functions ignored) Raster Unchecked Processes only the Vector functions for that particular color (Raster functions ignored) Does not process Vector or Raster functions for that particular color Air (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This checkbox controls the SmartAIR air-assist function (if you have the optional air compressor installed). By selecting a pen color and checking this box will enable the SmartAIR air-assist function for that particular pen color. As an example, if you are performing a combination of both surface raster engraving job and deep vector cutting on a material such as acrylic, you may want to enable the SmartAIR air-assist for the vector cutting sections to get the cleanest cuts. To do this, you would simply need to select the pen color that you have assigned to the sections to be cut and select the Air checkbox for those particular pen color. Auto Focus (Pen Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This checkbox sets the Auto Focus for that particular job. With the Auto Focus button checked, the Spirit GE will automatically initialize the auto focus procedure before starting the job. This will ensure the focal distance is properly set based on the particular material you are working with and the focal lens you have installed.","title":"Spirit GE Print Driver >> Pen Page"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#spirit-ge-print-driver-advance-page","text":"Scaling (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 0] In some cases you may find a slight output inaccuracy in the actual output compared to what you have set in the computer. This margin of error or offset is extremely small (approximately 1/300). What this means that there may be a 1-unit offset for every 300 unit increments. As an example, if you engrave a 300mm straight line, it may end up measuring only 299mm or 301mm in the final output. In this case, you will want to set the scaling setting to +1 / 1000 or -1 / 1000, respectively to compensate. A general rule of thumb is for every 300 unit increment, you will want to adjust the slider by +1 if the final output is 1 unit increment shorter or -1 if the final output is 1 unit increment longer than your graphic design setting. Position Modes (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Home] These selections allow you to control the positioning of the laser head after each job completion and before the next subsequent job. \udbc0\udc83 Home: Resets the positioning of the laser head to the \u2018home position\u2019 (upper-right) before and after each job. - 65 - Spirit GE User Manual \udbc0\udc83 Without Home: The laser head will start the next job based on its position from its graphic application software setting, from the last position of the previous job. Upon completion of the current job, the laser head will remain at the last position of the previous job. \udbc0\udc83 Relative: This mode sets the current laser head position to correspond to the origin (top left) position of the graphic software. Therefore, the laser head will process the job from its current position relative to its setting in the graphics software. \udbc0\udc83 Center: Sets the current position of the laser head as the center point for your subsequent job. As an example, if the subsequent job is to vector cut a circle and you have the Position Mode set to Center, then the Spirit GE will vector cut a circle around the initial position of the laser head. TIP It is highly recommended you enable the red dot laser pointer when setting / adjusting the Position Modes, as this makes accurate positioning of your laser carriage for your particular jobs much easier. Image Output Direction (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Top To Bottom] These selections allow you to control the direction in which the system processes an engraved image. \udbc0\udc83 Top To Bottom: Selecting this will force the system to process the current task by moving the laser carriage from the top to the bottom of the image (rear end to front end of the work table). \udbc0\udc83 Bottom To Top: Selecting this will force the system to process the current task by moving the laser carriage from the bottom to the top of the image (front end to rear end of the work table) (Normally, the LaserPro Spirit GE engraves from left to right, top to bottom. Selecting Bottom Up will force the machine to start from the bottom and work its way to the rear of the working table. TIP In situations where the material you will be working with may produce a lot of dust byproducts and you are utilizing the optional air extraction system, it is recommended you select the Bottom To Top image output direction option. This will minimize the amount of dust byproducts lodged in the engraved sections as the air extraction system is vented from the rear of the machine, the same direction as the image is processed. Border (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] In cases where you are working with a negative image (negative outline areas of your image are engraved, rather than the positive areas), you may wish to include a border around your image. To properly add a border, you will first need to Invert your design from the Option Page, then check Use Border and specify a value for the thickness of the border you would like to add to your design. This mode is useful for engraving rubber stamps, as it allows you to create the outline around your stamp image. NOTE If you wish to use the Border and Cluster function simultaneously, then the Border Thickness value must be less than the Distance value specified in the Cluster setting. Vector Function (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Normal] \udbc0\udc83 Normal: This selection will not apply any special advanced vector function to your job. This is the default Vector Function setting. \udbc0\udc83 All Raster Output: This selection will instruct the print driver to process your entire image as a raster engraving. Any vector lines within the image will be treated as raster data and outputted as a raster engraving, similar to a dot-matrix printer. \udbc0\udc83 Vector Sorting: When performing a vector cutting job in which your image has one vector cut area enclosing within another vector cut area, select the vector sorting mode. This mode will automatically instruct the print driver to process the inside vector image and moving outwards. If you try to process a vector image that has multiple layers without using this mode, what may occur is the laser engraver may process the outer vector cutting first, and any inner vector cutting will not be possible as your centerpiece material may have dropped to the cutting table. This setting will always automatically direct the laser to cut from the inner most vector shape and move outwards. \udbc0\udc83 Optimization Sorting: This is a setting that will minimize your process time. When selected, the print driver will analyze your image and automatically determine the most efficient processing path to process your image. Use Cluster (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This setting allows you to change how the Spirit GE interprets and processes individual / independent areas of an image in order to minimize job-processing times. The Cluster function is only applicable when multiple areas of an image are broken down and isolated from each other (areas not touching each other, blank space in-between). Another condition that must be met for the Cluster function is that these individual areas of your design must have some X-axis overlap, meaning that they should be somewhat side-by-side with empty space between them. The distance value can be set by the user and represents the limit or cutoff point in which side-by-side objects will be processed in Cluster mode or not. If the distance between side-by-side objects is greater than the set distance value, then the individual areas will be processed in Cluster mode. Conversely, if the distance between side-by-side objects is lesser than the set distance value, then the individual areas will be processed normally (not via Cluster mode). An example of an image that would benefit from the Cluster function would be: 2 squares to be engraved, side-by-side on the X-axis with a 20 cm gap in between them. In this scenario, you would want to enable the Cluster setting and set the distance to a value less than 20. By doing so, the laser will completely process one square and \u201cleap-frog\u201d to the second square, rather than processing both squares simultaneously. The result: you shorten the processing time by minimizing the unnecessary travel distance the laser head needs to make across the X-axis in between squares, if they were to be processed simultaneously. NOTE If you wish to use the Border and Cluster function simultaneously, then the Border Thickness value must be less than the Distance value specified in the Cluster setting. Enhanced Vector Mode (Advance Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] This setting allows you to improve the cutting quality at the expense of speed. Your engraving speed will be dropped 50%, to maximize the cutting power. We recommend you enable this function when cutting thicker materials.","title":"Spirit GE Print Driver >> Advance Page"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#spirit-ge-print-driver-paper-page","text":"Paper Size (Paper Page) The paper size represents your total work area. Ensure that the paper size is never set greater than the Spirit GE\u2019s worktable area of 25\u201d x 18\u201d (640mm x 460mm) or 29\u201d x 20\u201d (740mm x 460mm) with the Extend option checked. The X value represents the length and the Y value represents the width. NOTE When using the optional rotary attachment system and with the Rotary Fixture option checked, the X value represents the length of your working piece.

Unit (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Metric (mm)] Here you can set your preferred measurement standard in which you would like use with the Spirit GE print driver. You can choose between metric or imperial standards. Image Tuning (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: 0] In the event that you are processing extremely fine and detailed designs requiring near-microscopic edge-to-edge precision, you will need to adjust the image tuning setting. To adjust this setting, we recommend you engrave a small black square design as a sample and apply a magnifying glass to the engraved results. When you look at your engraved test square under a magnifying glass, you may notice the edges of your square may be slightly offset, with every consecutive engraved even or odd line protruding past the square\u2019s ideal edge. This occurrence may occur on the left or right side of the square and can be compensated for by the image tuning setting. In the diagram below, the arrows refer to the direction the laser head is moving to generate that engraved line. If the first and every other line protrude to the left of the square\u2019s ideal edge, you will want to set the image tuning to a negative value. If the first and every other consecutive line protrude to the right of the square\u2019s ideal edge, you will want to set the image tuning to a positive value. The further the protruding lines are from the square\u2019s ideal edge, the larger you will need to set the Image Tuning value to compensate. The following is an example of how having the proper image tuning is important when engraving fine, small, intricate text. The following two pictures show engraved text magnified with no image tuning (left picture) and image tuning enabled (right picture). Extend (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] If you are processing a very large area requiring the maximum worktable area, you will want to enable this mode. Enabling this mode will extend the Spirit GE\u2019s maximum work area to 38\u201d x 18\u201d (960mm x 460mm), from the default 32\u201d x 18\u201d (812 mm x 460mm).

Dual Head (Paper Page) [DEFAULT SETTING: Unselected] NOTE This option is only to be used with the Dual-Head optional accessory properly set up. For instructions on how to set up the Dual Head, please refer to Chapter VII of this manual. This function allows you to process two identical jobs at the same time through the employment of a secondary laser carriage. With the dual-head optional accessory properly set up: 1) Check the Dual-Head function to enable it. The X (width) value of the paper size will shrink from 64cm to 37cm, to accommodate for simultaneous jobs. The Y (height) value remains the same. 2) Simply lay out your work on a maximum page size of 31cm x 46cm.

This mode will allow you to select from three diffusion types: Floyd, Stucki, and Jarvis. o Diffusion Type: Floyd, Stucki, Jarvis [DEFAULT SETTING: Floyd] Each diffusion type presents the shade of image as different spread halftones instead of dots to compose a raster image. The following diagram is an example of the raster effects when using the different diffusion types. Floyd Stucki Jarvis TIP There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d setting when using the Raster options. The most appropriate settings will be based on a variety of factors: your design, the material you are engraving on, the results you wish to achieve, etc. Please take some time to experiment with the multitude of raster options to get the one you feel is the best for your piece. This is where much of the fun in engraving is\u2026.experimentation! - 75 - Spirit GE User Manual 5.2.3.7 Spirit GE Print Driver >> Stamp Page Producing stamps require different operational steps than your standard engraving or cutting jobs. The Stamp page offers dynamic options allowing you to customize your stamp production process. NOTE The Stamp page will only appear and be accessible when you have selected the Stamp Mode from the Option Page. TIP Functions located on the other pages that are useful when making a stamp: Set Shoulder, Pitch, Border, Invert, and Mirror. Pitch (Stamp Page) Your stamp will be a reversed image composed of engraved depressions and ridges. Think of these ridges as the \u201ccontact sections\u201d of the stamp. If the ridges of these contact sections are too thin, they may break. The Pitch setting allows you to increase the width of the ridge base, hence creating more stable \u201ccontact sections\u201d and longer lasting stamp. The pitch value setting allows you to adjust the base width of Base of ridge (Pitch) Slope of ridge (Shoulder Level) Ridge: \u201cContact section\u201d of the stamp the ridge. Broad pitch gives the maximum amount of support for each ridge. Experiment with different pitch value settings in order to produce the stamp that is best suited for your application. Adjustment Bar / Power Level (Stamp Page) Another important aspect of creating a stamp is setting the slope level of the shoulder. The shoulder is the section from the \u201ccontact section\u201d of the stamp to its base. This function allows you to adjust the slope for the shoulder sections of your stamp. By sliding the sliders or directly input of power levels, you will be able to change the slope of the shoulder. NOTE The visual representations of the Pitch and Shoulder Levels in the Spirit GE driver are an exaggerated representation to allow for easy visual guidance and precise input. Remember we are working with distances less than 1 mm here.","title":"Spirit GE Print Driver >> Language Page"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#engraving-and-cutting-techniques","text":"","title":"Engraving and Cutting Techniques"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#raster-engraving","text":"A laser engraver can process text, scanned image, digital picture, or design by \u201claser firing\u201d grids / dots of individual pixels into a raster image.

When performing vector cutting operations, imagine the laser head as a pair of scissors cutting out the lines specified in your design. An example of a vector cut piece would be a customized dining mat, as shown in the picture below. The Spirit GE Print Driver determines which sections should be raster engraved or vector cut based on the outline width of that particular area or section of the design. In order to prep a particular section for vector cutting, you will need to set that object\u2019s fill color to white and set its outline thickness between 0.001\u201d (0.025mm) to 0.004\u201d (0.1mm) via the graphics software. Below is an example of how to prep an area (in this case, we will use a section of text) for vector cutting. CorelDraw will be used as the selected graphics software. 1) With the text function, create a string of characters and select those characters by clicking on the text. 2) Change the text fill color of the selected characters to white by left clicking on the white color from the CorelDraw Color Palette (located on the right hand side of the screen). 3) Change the outline color of the selected characters outline by right clicking on the desired color from the CorelDraw Color Palette. 4) Change the selected characters outline thickness to the thinnest width by right clicking on the selected text \udbc0\udcc6 select \udbc0\udcc6 Click on the tab and change the Width to its thinnest dimension. Click on \u201cOK\u201d to apply the changes. 5) Now your string of characters has been properly designated as an area to be vector cut. Simply \u201cprint\u201d your job (output the file to the Spirit) and watch as your string of characters is vector cut.","title":"Vector Cutting"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#vector-and-raster","text":"In some cases, you will want to process both raster engraving and vector cutting tasks within a single project. For example, if you wanted to engrave a design onto a particular material and then cut a particular shape around that engraving. The picture below is an example of an engraving on a piece of cork, which has then been cut out with a square shape: In these situations when there are raster engraving and vector cutting operations on a single project, the LaserPro Spirit GE driver will interpret between raster sections and vector sections by the types of lines and line widths of your design. Areas of your design with line widths set between 0.001\u201d (0.025mm), 0.004\u201d (0.1mm) will be designate for vector cutting, and the other areas will be designated for raster engraving.","title":"Vector and Raster"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#3d-tips","text":"When doing 3D sample on LaserPro Spirit GE, acrylic or MDF wood are ideal materials for the purpose.

(REVISE THIS SECTION WITH MORE SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS, INSTEAD OF GENERALITIES) The perfect image for 3D is like those shown below. When image is ready, choose 3D Effect as the output mode in the driver. Sometimes, some material (WHAT SORT OF MATERIALS?) shows better effect if you run the job with 2 nd pass with laser out-of-focus. Especially with acrylic, the 2 nd pass will smooth out the surface. For engraving wood, as it burns easily and leaves blackened surface after the 1 st pass, it is necessary to run the 2 nd pass to remove the burned surface. To do that, simply fill the image with black color as the mask (see below) and Run the black mask image with PWR 100% and SPD100%.","title":"3D Tips"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#important-commands","text":"Structure: * http://www.laserprona.com/spirit-ge-2-2/","title":"Important commands"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#external-links","text":"1","title":"External links"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#maintenance","text":"","title":"Maintenance"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Spirit_GE_Laser_Cutter/#downloads","text":"User Manual Category:Machines Category:Machines","title":"Downloads"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Laser%20Cutting/_wiki/Trotec_Speedy_100R/","text":"Technical specifications \u00b6 '''Brand: Trotec Speedy 100 '''Power: 12-60 watts '''Work area: 610 x 305 mm '''Materials: wood (5mm), methacrylate or perspex (5mm), cardboard (8mm) , paper, fabrics, non-PVC acrylics and other organic materials.

These components are very straightforward to use and it's actually quite easy to program the robots using them. Rhino File Setup \u00b6 When you work with the robots using KUKA|prc your units in Rhino must be configured for the Metric system using millimetres. The easiest way to do this is to use the pull-down menus and select File > New... then from the dialogue presented chose \"Small Objects - Millimeters\" as your template. - Orientation Axes: The other joints (4, 5, 6). These joints are always rotary. Pitch / Roll / Yaw = Orientation Axes. These are the axes closer to the tool. When installing KUKA|prc has a user interface (UI) much like other Grasshopper plug-ins. The UI consists of the palettes in the KUKA|prc menu. There are five palettes which organize the components. These are: 01 | Core: The main Core component is here (discussed below). There are also the components for the motion types (linear, spline, etc.). 02 | Virtual Robot: The various KUKA robots are here. We'll mostly be using the KUKA gelis KR6-10 R900 component as those are what are used in the Agilus work cell. 03 | Virtual Tools: Approach and Retract components are here (these determine how the robot should move after a toolpath has completed). There are also components for dividing up curves and surfaces and generating robotic motion based on that division. 04 | Toolpath Utilities: The tools (end effectors) are here. We'll mostly be using the Custom Tool component. 05 | Utilities: The components dealing with input and outputs are stored here. These will be discussed later. KUKA|prc CORE \u00b6 The component you always use in every definition is called the Core. It is what generates the KUKA Robot Language (KRL) code that runs on the robot. It also provides the graphical simulation of the robot motion inside Rhino. Everything else gets wired into this component. The Core component takes five inputs. These are: SIM- This is a numeric value. Attach a default slider with values from 0.00 to 1.00 to control the simulation. CMDS- This is the output of one of the KUKA|prc Command components. For example a Linear motion command could be wired into this socket. TOOL- This is the tool (end effector) to use. It gets wired from one of the Tool components available in the Virtual Tools panel. Usually, you'll use the KUKA|prc Custom Tool option and wire in a Mesh component will show the tool geometry in the simulation. ROBOT - This is the robot to use. The code will be generated for this robot and the simulation will graphically depict this robot. You'll wire in one of the robots from the Virtual Robot panel. For the Agilus Workcell, you'll use the Agilus KR6-10 R900 component. COLLISION - This is an optional series of meshes that define collision geometry. Enable collision checking in the KUKA|prc settings to make use of this. Note that collision checking has a large, negative impact on KUKA|prc performance. There are two output as well: GEO: This is the geometry of the robot at the current position - as a set of meshes. You can right-click on this socket and choose Bake to generate a mesh version of the robot for any position in the simulation. You can use this for renderings for example. ANALYSIS: This provides a detailed analysis of the simulation values. This has to be enabled for anything to appear. You enable it in the Settings dialogue, Advanced page, Output Analysis Values checkbox. Then use the Analysis component from the Utilities panel. For example, if you wire a Panel component into the Axis Values socket you'll see all the axis values for each command that's run. Settings \u00b6 The grey KUKA|prc Settings label at the bottom of the Core component gives you access to its settings. Simply left click on the label and the dialog will appear. The settings are organized into pages which you select from along the top edge of the dialog (Settings, Advanced, and Analysis). The dialog is modeless which means you can operate Rhino while it is open. To see the effect of your changes in the viewport click the Apply button. These settings will be covered in more detail later. Basic Setup There is a common set of components used in nearly all definitions for use with the Agilus Workcell. Not surprisingly, these correspond to the inputs on the Core component. Here is a very typical setup: SIM SLIDER: The simulation Slider goes from 0.000 to 1.000. Dragging it moves the robot through all the motion specified by the Command input. It's often handy to drag the right edge of this slider to make it much wider than the default size. This gives you greater control when you scrub to watch the simulation. You may also want to increase the precision from a single decimal point to several (say 3 or 4). Without that precision, you may not be able to scrub to all the points you want to visualize the motion going through. You can also add a Play/Pause component. This lets you simulate without dragging the time slider. CMDS: The components which get wired into the CMDS slot of the Core is really the heart of your definition and will obviously depend on what you are intending the robot to do. In the example above a simple Linear Move, the component is wired in. TOOL: We normally use custom tools with the Agilus Workcell. Therefore a Mesh component gets wired into the KUKA|prc Custom Tool component (labelled TOOL above). This gets wired into the TOOL slot of the Core. The Mesh component points to a mesh representation of the tool drawn in the Rhino file. See the section below on Tool orientation and configuration. ROBOT: The robots we have in the Agilus Workcell are KUKA KR6 R900s. So that component is chosen to form the Virtual Robots panel. It gets wired into the ROBOT slot of the Core. COLLISION: If you want to check for collisions between the robot and the work cell (table) wire in the meshes which represent the work cell. As noted above this has a large negative impact on performance so use this only when necessary. Robot Position and Orientation \u00b6 The Agilus workcell has two robots named Mitey and Titey. Depending on which one you are using you'll need to set up some parameters so your simulation functions correctly. These parameters specify the location and orientation of the robot within the workcell 3D model. Note: The latest revision of Kuka|prc contains a custom robot for the Agilus workcell. It has two output sockets, Mitey and Titey. Simply wire in the robot you intend to use and no more configuration is required. If you don't have the latest version, see below for how to set them up. MITEY Mitey is the name of the robot mounted in the table. Its base is at 0,0,0. The robot is rotated about its vertical axis 180 degrees. That is, the cable connections are on the right side of the robot base as you face the front of the workcell. To set up Mitey do the following: Bring up the Settings dialog by left clicking on KUKA|prc Settings label on the Core component. The dialog presented is shown below: You specify the X, Y, and Z offsets in the Base X, Base Y, and Base Zdialogues of the dialog. Again, for Mitey these should all be 0. In order to rotate the robot around the vertical axis you specify 180 in the Base A field. You can see that the A axis corresponds to vertical in the diagram. Base X: 0 Base Y: 0 Base Z: 0 Base A: 180 Base B: 0 Base C: 0 After you hit Apply the robot position will be shown in the viewport. You can close the dialog with the Exit button in the upper right corner. TITEY The upper robot hanging from the fixture is named Titey. It has a different X, Y and Z offset values and rotations. Use the settings below when your definition should run on Titey. Note: These values are all in millimetres. Base X: 1102.5 Base Y: 0 Base Z: 1125.6 Base A: 90 Base B: 180 Base C: 0 Code Output \u00b6 The purpose of KUKA|prc is to generate the code which runs on the robot controller. This code is usually in the Kuka Robot Language (KRL). You need to tell KUKA|prc what directory and file name to use for its code output. Once you've done this, as you make changes in the UI, the output will be re-written as necessary to keep the code up to date with the Grasshopper definition. To set the output directory and file name follow these steps: Bring up the Settings dialogue via the Core component. On the main Settings page, enter the project filename and choose an output directory. Note: See the? button in the dialogue for recommendations on the filename (which characters to avoid). Start Position / End Position \u00b6 When you work with robots there are certain issues you always have to deal with: Reach: Can the robot's arms reach the entire workpiece? Singularities: Will any joint positions result in singularities? (See below for more on this topic) Joint Limits: During the motion of the program will any of the axes hit their limits? One setting which has a major impact on these is the Start Position. The program needs to know how the tool is positioned before the motion starts. This value is VERY important. That's because it establishes an initial placement for the joint limits. Generally, you should choose a start position that doesn't have any of the joints near their rotation limits - otherwise, your programmed path may cause them to hit the joint limit. This is a really common error. Make sure you aren't unintentionally near any of the axes limits. Also, the robot will move from it's current position (wherever that may be) to the start position. It could move right through your workpiece or fixture setup. So make sure you are aware of where the start position is, and make sure there's a clear path from the current position of the robot to the start position. In other words, jog the robot near to the start position to begin. That'll ensure the motion won't hit your set up. You specify these start and end position values in the Settings of the Core. Bring up the settings dialog and choose the Advanced page. Under the Start / Endposition section, you enter the axis values for A1 through A6. This begs the questions \"how do I know what values to use?\". You can read these directly from the physical robot pendant. That is, you jog the robot into a reasonable start position and read the values from the pendant display. Enter the values into the dialog. Then do the same for the End values. See the section Jogging the Robot in topic Taubman College Agilus Workcell Operating Procedure. You can also use KUKA|prc to visually set a start position and read the axis values to use. To do this you wire in the KUKA|prc Axis component into the Core component. You can \"virtually jog\" the robot to a specific position using a setup like this: Then simply read the axis values from your sliders and enter these as the Start Position or End Position. Another way is to move the simulation to the start point of the path. Then read the axis values from the Analysis output of the Core Settings dialog. You can see the numbers listed from A01 to A06. Jot these down, one decimal place is fine. Then enter them on the Advanced page. Initial Posture \u00b6 Related to the Start Point is the Initial Posture setting. If you've set the Start Position as above and are still seeing motion (like a big shift in one of the axis to reorient) try the As Start option. This sets the initial posture to match the start position.","title":"KUKA PRC"},{"location":"know-how/machines/Robotics/_wiki/KUKA_PRC/#robot-programming-with-kukaprc","text":"All the information explained here is coming from: <http://mkmra2.blogspot.com/2016/01/robot-programming-with-kukaprc.html> All the information explained here is coming from: <http://mkmra2.blogspot.com/2016/01/robot-programming-with-kukaprc.html> KUKA|prc is a set of Grasshopper components that provide Procedural Robot Control for KUKA robots (thus the name PRC).

Official bids from non- interested countries will be awaited until 2018 before being evaluated until February 2020. The announcement time is stremaing live piala dunia two years before the 2022 World Cup was held in Qatar. The 22 nd World Cup was held for the first time in the Middle East region known to have high temperatures. As for the World Cup 2018 or the closest of now will be held in Russia. The host selection stage for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups begins in January 2009. Each national football parent of the interested country has until February 2 to register. At first there were seven countries that signed up for the 2022 World Cup, but then Mexico resigned. During the election process, non-UEFA countries gradually resigned from 2018 host elections, ultimately won by Russia. While UEFA countries resigned from host elections in 2022, live online piala dunia streaming until the remaining five countries only, namely the United States, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Qatar. On voting on December 22, 2010, Qatar got the most votes. Indonesia had proposed the official nomination to host the 2022 World Cup on behalf of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). On 19 March 2010 the nomination was rejected by FIFA due to lack of support from the government. The government feels that the nomination will not be supported by the people of Indonesia (ANT).","title":"PopUp
